The spread of Vipassana in India has an interesting history. The technique of Vipassana had been re-discovered by the Buddha and preserved in Burma in the teacher-disciple tradition. Goenkaji’s teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin, sincerely wanted to pay back Burma’s debt to India by returning the technique of Vipassana meditation to the land of its origin. Circumstances did not permit him to come to India and teach Vipassana himself, but his student Mr. S. N. Goenka, whom he had given thorough training to become a teacher of Vipassana, had the opportunity to do so. After facing initial difficulties, the first Vipassana course was held by Mr. Goenka at Panchayatiwadi, Mumbai in July 1969. Fourteen students participated in this course. The second course was held in the same year at Agarwal Bhavan, Chennai, which was attended by fifteen students. Gradually the numbers began to increase.<br/><br/>

Initially there were several difficulties in organizing courses. Those who wanted to organize courses had to arrange for facilities like accommodation and food among other facilities. But people who had derived benefits from Vipassana sincerely wanted others also to have the opportunity to try it and get the benefits. So they did not lose heart. As Goenkaji recalls, “These people derived no material advantage from their work, nor did they expect any, not even name and fame. It was simply because they had benefited from this wonderful technique that they wanted more and more people to benefit”. This had a miraculous effect. Slowly and steadily Vipassana began to spread and people came to know about it by word of mouth. Another important factor that greatly contributed to the spread of Vipassana in the initial days was Goenkaji’s indefatigable zeal to travel the length and breadth of India to introduce Vipassana to the people. Between July 1969 and February 1998, Mr. Goenka conducted more than 425 courses across India.<br/><br/>

In a country where the teachings of the Buddha were largely unknown or regarded with distrust, Goenkaji found a way to present the essence of Dhamma. He emphasized the universal nature of human suffering and taught how to overcome it through a process of self-observation, that removes one's mental impurities, irrespective of a person's religious or cultural traditions. Over the time, large numbers of people from different religions, ethnic groups and castes started participating in courses. Leaders of various religions joined in too. Leaders of the Hindu Samaj and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad sat courses and encouraged others in their communities to participate. Prominent leaders in the Christian community and many Christian priests and nuns also sat courses. Mother Superior Mary at Dalhousie (H.P.) once told Goenkaji, "You are teaching Christianity in the name of Buddha". In Kutch, two courses were held in a mosque, where leaders in Muslim communities also attended courses and encouraged many to sit the course. In Northern India and in Nagpur, Buddhist monks and nuns attended courses.One by one, all the communities started to join the courses.<br/><br/>

Some of these students decided to establish Vipassana centers at Igatpuri, Hyderabad and Jaipur. They left no stone unturned to create facilities at the centers so that Vipassana courses could be held continuously. The three centers were then followed by setting up a center in Kutch. In this way many centers, one after the other, were established, and at present there are about 80 centers and 13 non-center locations in India that cater to the needs of those who aspire to lead a pure and peaceful life.<br/><br/>

These centers are supported by over 500 teachers and assistant teachers in India, who help Goenkaji's mission of spreading Dhamma. Vipassana courses are now held regularly at all these centers and at many non-center locations. Thus, Dhamma is growing stronger and stronger in the country of its origin.
