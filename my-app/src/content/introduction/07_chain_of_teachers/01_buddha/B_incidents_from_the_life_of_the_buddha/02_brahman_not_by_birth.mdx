          ###  Brahman-not by birth, but by action

          <Divider />

            The Buddha was once living in the forest near Icchhānangala. At that
            time many well-known and wealthy brahmans were also staying there.
            Of them, there were two famous brahman teachers named Poskarasāti
            and Tārukṣa. Each of them had a disciple. Poskarasāti's disciple was
            called Vāśisṭa and Tāruksa's was called Bhāradvāja. A discussion on
            the topic, "how does one become a brahman?" arose between the two.
            <br />
            <br />
            Bhāradvāja was of the view, that one is a brahman if one is born to
            parents whose lineage back to seven generations is pure. By virtue
            of this, one becomes a brahman. Young Vāśisṭa, on the other hand,
            said that if one is virtuous and moral, he is a brahman. When the
            two could not come to a conclusion, they approached the Buddha,
            introduced themselves to him and requested him to explain whether
            one is a brahman by birth or by action.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Blessed One explained to them in detail giving reasons for the
            differences among all beings. Their birth is their distinctive mark.
            All species of living beings are different from one another because
            of their birth. Various kinds of trees, plants and grass are also
            different from one another. Insects, flies and ants have different
            distinctive marks. Various kinds of snakes, aquatic creatures, fish
            and birds have different distinctive marks. Human beings, on the
            other hand, do not have such distinctive marks. Every limb of the
            body of a creature or being is different from the limbs of other
            creatures. But as far as man is concerned all parts of the body of
            all men are the same.
            <br />
            <br />
            The differences in men are only external. One who earns his
            livelihood by keeping cattle is a peasant. One who carries goods is
            a laborer. Those who eke out their living by any handiwork, craft or
            art, are called potters, iron-smiths, carpenters, etc., depending on
            their profession. The one who trades for his livelihood is called a
            trader. One who steals from others to make a living is called a
            thief. One who lives by using arms and armaments is called a
            soldier. One who possesses land and villages is called the King.
            None amongst them is a brahman.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then, the Lord said, that no human being becomes a brahman just by
            virtue of being born to a particular mother. He explained further
            the qualities, by virtue of which a person becomes a brahman.
            <br />
            <br />
            He, who does not hoard, who is free of attachment and greed, is
            fearless having broken all fetters that bind him to the wheel of
            birth and death, who has driven out anger and craving from the mind,
            who has broken himself free from all wrong views (62 kinds of wrong
            views were prevalent in those days), who is fully enlightened, him I
            call a brahman.
            <br />
            <br />
            I call him a brahman, one who bears insults and pains without
            reaction, without being angry i.e. without polluting his mind, whose
            strength is forgiveness, who is free from anger, who is virtuous,
            moral, learned, and abstemious, and for whom this is the last birth.
            I call him a brahman who does not cling to sensual pleasures like
            the water drops on a lotus leaf, or in whom jealousy, pride,
            craving, and aversion do not stick, like a mustard seed on the tip
            of a needle, who has ended sorrow in this life and has thrown off
            all his burden, who is of deep wisdom, learned, who knows what is
            the path and what is not the path, is honest, who is neither
            attached to householders nor to those who have left home for the
            homeless life, who neither kills any being, nor instigates others to
            kill, who is peaceful amongst adversaries, without any stick amongst
            those armed with sticks, a non-hoarder amongst hoarders, who is
            respectful, and whose words are sweet and true, words that never
            hurt others, a person so qualified I call a brahman.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thus, the Blessed One described further the virtues of a brahman.
            One who doesn’t take anything in this world which is not given to
            him, who is free from craving for this life or the life beyond, who
            has realized the ultimate truth, who shows the path to liberation,
            who is free from sorrow, who is untainted and pure, who is attached
            neither to sin nor to virtue, whose cravings for all his births have
            been rooted out, who has forsaken the ignorance that causes the
            cycle of birth and death, who has become an ascetic giving up all
            enjoyments, who is unfettered by all worldly and heavenly bonds, and
            who having discarded the likes and dislikes has become calm and cool
            and free from defilements, such a universally victorious person do I
            call a brahman. One who knows the passing away and arising of all
            beings very well, who is desire less, free from rebirth, who is
            endowed with wisdom, him I call a brahman. Neither a Deva, nor a
            Gandharva, nor a man knows his course, who is free from taints, is
            an arahant, who has nothing before, after or in the middle, who is
            without any property, who knows his previous births, sees heaven and
            hell, who is not going to be reborn, all that he had to do has been
            done, and who is an enlightened sage, him I call a brahman."
            <br />
            <br />
            One is not a brahman or a non-brahman by birth. One is a brahman or
            a non-brahman by actions. One's occupation makes one a peasant, and
            another an artisan. Occupation makes one a trader and another a
            laborer. Actions make one a thief and another a soldier. Action
            makes one a beggar and it is action alone which makes one a king. In
            this way, the wise man who knows the results of kamma, knows this
            life very well. The world moves on because of kamma (actions),
            people also move in the cycle of birth and death because of kamma.
            All beings are tied to their actions like the moving wheels of a
            chariot tied to the axle. Meditation, living a holy life, abstinence
            from sensual pleasures and controlling the mind – these make one a
            brahman. Those who have these qualities are the best brahmans.
            <br />
            <br />
            Though those two were young, even the elders of the Brahman
            community frequently discussed the topic.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here is an incident from the life of the Buddha. Once when the
            Buddha was living in Anāthapindika's Jetavana monastery, 500
            Brahmans from different places gathered in Srāvastī;. Their topic of
            discussion was that Gotama does not make a distinction between high
            and low castes. He teaches Dhamma to people of the lowest caste and
            makes them respected and revered. We are not able to debate with him
            on this point."
            <br />
            <br />
            One amongst those Brahmans was Ᾱśvalāyana. Though young, he was an
            expert of the Vedic literature. It is believed that he was the same
            Ᾱśvalāyana , who later became a scholar in the Upaniṣadic era. Hence
            the group of Brahmans felt that Ᾱśvalāyana was capable of debating
            with the Buddha on that topic and helped him get ready. Although he
            repeatedly said that the Buddha speaks the words of Dhamma, and it
            is difficult to debate with him, but because of the pressure of
            those brahmans, Ᾱśvalāyana became ready to debate with the Buddha.
            <br />
            <br />
            When he met the Buddha, he said that the Brahmans claim that they
            are the highest caste, others are inferior. They are fair, others
            are dark, only the Brahmans are pure, and others are not. Brahmans
            are born of Brahmā, are born of his mouth and they are his true
            heirs.
            <br />
            <br />
            To this the Buddha replied, "Ᾱśvalāyana, the brahman women also
            menstruate, become pregnant, give birth to children and suckle them;
            so how can we accept that they are born of the mouth of Brahmā?"
            <br />
            <br />
            Aśvalāyana remained silent. He could not refute.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Blessed One further said, "If any Brahmā has decreed mankind to
            be high and low, then why are there only two classes of mankind in
            the neighboring countries and in other bordering states - noble and
            slave? There, if one is a noble, he can become a slave and a slave
            can become a noble." Aśvalāyana accepted that in these states and
            countries, this is how things are.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Buddha then asked him the special quality of the brahmans on
            account of which they consider themselves to be the heirs of Brahmā.
            <br />
            <br />
            Aśvalāyana had no answer to give.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Buddha further said that if a Kṣatriya is cruel, if he is a
            thief, is immoral, if he speaks harsh words then he will be born in
            hell after his death. In the same way, the Vaiśya (traders) and the
            Sūdra(menial workers) will also meet the same fate i.e. they will go
            to hell if they are like him. Will a Brahmin not be born in hell if
            he has these characteristics?
            <br />
            <br />
            Aśvalāyana had no answer to this.
            <br />
            <br />
            "Similarly, if a man is of good conduct, he will go to heaven on
            death, whatever be his caste."
            <br />
            <br />
            Aśvalāyana remained silent.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Blessed One said, "Whether one is a brahman or a non-brahman, he
            can remove his dirt by applying soap on his body and taking a bath
            in the river. Then why is a brahman special? Similarly, one
            belonging to any caste can, on coming to me, remove the defilements
            of his mind and become a Dhammic person. It is not necessary for him
            to be a brahman. Everyone has the right to be moral and upright. And
            everyone who becomes moral and upright will get the same results. I
            call such a meditator a real brahman. Any meditator, regardless of
            caste, can be rightfully called a brahman if he practices
            meditation, lives a holy life, controls his sense organs and mind.
            Such a meditator, I call a superior brahman. One belonging to a so
            called lower caste can also achieve purity by his wholesome actions
            and good conduct."
            <br />
            <br />
            Aśvalāyana again found no suitable reply to give.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Buddha further asked, "If a Brahman young man marries a young
            non-Brahman woman, or if any non-Brahman young man marries a young
            Brahman woman, then what will you call the child of such a couple?
            Superior or inferior? A brahman or a sūdra?"
            <br />
            <br />
            Aśvalāyana remained silent.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Buddha further said that when a horse mates a donkey the
            offspring is called neither a horse nor a donkey. Rather, it is
            called a mule. But what will you call the child of a brahman father
            and a non-brahman mother? Will he be called a high caste brahman or
            a low caste sūdra? How will you differentiate?
            <br />
            <br />
            Man is man. There are no differences. Every one, whether one belongs
            to the brahman caste or to any other caste, has the right to be
            moral and upright. All who are moral and upright get the same
            result.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, thousands of years before the Buddha, the country was
            ridden with high and low castes and untouchability. There were other
            bad practices. The sight of a Cāndāla was considered unlucky and an
            ill-omen. Leave alone his touch, one needed to bathe, if even his
            shadow fell on him. So, a Cāndāla, had to come clapping or ringing
            bells from a distance thus intimating the group of people of his
            coming. Many would wash their eyes with perfumed water, if their
            eyes fell on a Cāndāla. Often, people would beat a Cāndāla, if his
            shadow fell on them. Cāndāla would keep their eyes lowered when they
            entered the village.
            <br />
            <br />
            It seems that even after the Buddha, Cāndāla would carry corpse and
            guard the cremation ground. They lived in separate villages and
            there were separate cremation grounds for burning their dead bodies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from Cāndāla, there were also others, who were considered to
            be very low. They were Nesadas i.e. those who made cane/ bamboo
            baskets, Camārs, i.e. those who made objects from the leather of
            dead animals and Pukkusas, i.e. sweepers and cleaners who would
            dispose of human excreta.
            <br />
            <br />
            The members of the Cāndāla clan were considered outcastes. The
            Buddha described who truly is an outcaste. "The man who is hot
            tempered, jealous and hostile, is a sinner, holds wrong view, is a
            fraud, is cruel, is a tormentor, is a thief, is licentious; one who
            doesn't take care of his old parents, troubles others, deceives
            brahmans, monks or other beggars; utters words that cause harm;
            hides his immoral acts; praises himself and derides others; who is
            angry, is a glutton, who is full of ill-desires; is a miser, is
            wicked; is neither ashamed nor afraid of wrong doings; who calls
            himself fully liberated without being so; such a man is an outcaste
            and despicable. One is neither an outcaste by birth nor a brahman by
            birth. Actions make one an outcaste and another a brahman. A brahman
            doing unwholesome actions is a Cāndāla.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Buddha said, "I do not call one a brahman, because he is born to
            a brahman mother. I call him a brahman, one who possesses nothing
            and who takes nothing. Not by matted hair, nor by clan or family
            (caste) nor by birth does one become a brahman, but one who is
            truthful and righteous, pure and dhammic is a brahman."
            <br />
            <br />
            The Buddha always put a premium on one's knowledge and conduct, not
            on his caste.
            <br />
            <br />
            Come meditators! Let us also be inspired by the pure teachings of
            the Blessed One, improve our conduct, perform wholesome actions and
            become brahmans in the true sense of the term!
