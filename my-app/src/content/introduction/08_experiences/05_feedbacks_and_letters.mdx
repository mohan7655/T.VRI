#### Letters from Students

<Divider />

Respected S. N. Goenka,<br/><br/>

I am happy, at long last I found the time and determination to attend the 10-day Vipassana course at Dhamma Khetta, Hyderabad. I am totally convinced by the potential of the technique, though as you have been rightly emphasising that this is only the first step in a long, long and difficult path.<br/><br/>

But certainly, even now, I am able to realise the great potential this path has for humanity, particularly in this country where many conflicts, miseries and tensions are growing day by day. As you have rightly said, "What is necessary at the moment is the mastery of the mind and not only mastery of the matter."<br/><br/>

I was also highly impressed by the dedication, commitment and sincerity of the persons in charge of the Centre, as well as the competence, commitment and compassion of the teachers.<br/><br/>

I have no hesitation in expressing my appreciation and admiration for the efforts to bring solace, happiness, peace, harmony and liberation to millions of people.<br/><br/>

In fact, I have already written a report to the Director, CBI, and Director General, CRPF, that we should explore ways of either sending our own officers to your centres or introducing it in our own training institutions.

My family too is planning to sit Vipassana courses.<br/><br/>

With kind regards,<br/>

##### Vipassana in Iran

_These are excerpts from letters faxed to S. N. Goenka from Vipassana meditators in Iran (a large group of Iranian male and female students did a 10-day course in Dhamma Giri in the winter of 1996)_.<br/><br/>

_Your students are grateful for the valuable technique of Vipassana. They have regular groups sittings in Tehran, and at the end of every session send mettā to you and all Vipassana meditators_. - **_Dr. Abbas Rouhbachsh_**<br/><br/>

_Being in Dhamma Giri for ten days made me face my inner hell for a few days, and then made me find my little heaven inside_. - **_Mrs. Ravan Kahriz_**<br/><br/>

_Do you remember the bird in your (Teacher's Residence) garden singing anicca ? a..n..i..c..c..a..!!_ - **_Homa Arzhangi_**<br/><br/>

_I will never forget this valuable sentence : "Be your own master._" - **_Fatemeh Rahshenas_**<br/><br/>

_We hope that, as soon as possible, we have a Vipassana centre in Iran_. - **_Ramin Aminian_**<br/><br/>

_The ten-day course in Dhamma Giri was the most peaceful days of my life_. - **_Mohammad Eyvazi_**<br/><br/>

(_Messages also came from Kamran Abbasi, Fatemeh Nejad, Farzaneh Edalatmanesh, Mahsa Binazir, Nazila Garousian, Zohre Pour-Miraghaiy, Abdolah Esmail-Nasab, Mohammad Eyvazi, Maryam Nowghan, Kiandokt Nowghan, Farzaneh Toossi, Fariba Shams, Fariba Namazi, Shahrzad Pakzad, Maryam Ghatrifi, Mehsa Binazir_).<br/><br/>

Every life is a preparation for the next death. If someone is wise, he or she will use this life to the best advantage and prepare for a good death... Make this human life successful by practicing Vipassana. Then whenever death comes, it will come with the experience of an equanimous mind, bringing with it well-being for the future.

Dear S.N.Goenka,<br/><br/>

A dream has come true. The first Vipassana course in Ireland has finally happened. It was wonderful and a privilege to serve the Irish people as they received the wonderful Dhamma on their own soil.<br/><br/>

Ireland was once known as the Island of Saints and scholars. But in the past thirty years it is best known for sectarian violence and bombs and terrorist activity. We so badly need Dhamma. Thank you for sending teachers who have been such an inspiration to us.<br/><br/>

There is so much goodwill for us to get established here. Members of the Dhamma community in England have been so supportive.<br/><br/>

May the Dhamma continue to spread throughout the world. May all beings be happy !<br/><br/>

With mettā,<br/>

Dear Goenkaji,<br/><br/>

Thank you very much for teaching me the technique of Vipassana. It has had an immediate effect on my life, and deals piercingly with so many things that had surfaced before, but I was then unaware of what to do. Now with Vipassana, it feels like you can be your own doctor, and get to the deepest roots of anything that caused your unhappiness.<br/><br/>

Dear Goenkaji,<br/><br/>

Although I have not been able to go to Dhammagiri this winter, there have been plenty of occasions to grow in the Dhamma. Our own mind and body is a wonderful meditation cell!<br/>

...It is amazing how much the Dhamma has helped me to change for the better. From a proud, passionate and selfish person, I have changed to a much less passionate, more moderate, more compassionate individual.<br/>

In law there is a sacred principle that says: “Not only must justice be rendered, it must appear to be rendered.”<br/>

In my appreciation of Vipassana I strongly believe that: “Not only must peace be achieved, it must appear to be achieved in daily life.”<br/><br/>

#### Feedback from the Course Participants

<Divider />

...One of the reasons I chose Nepal for my Peace Corps work is that I had hoped I would find a good meditation way in India during my service in Nepal. A ten-year search in America had brought nothing that satisfied me. Only a person like yourself, who has received the Dhamma, can understand how very grateful and joyful I feel at finally having found what I know is right for me.

We would like to thank you again for starting us on the path to enlightenment. In return we will continue to develop the technique, the only sufficient form of thanks we can render.

Vipassana is of immense importance for the development of a human being. Lord Buddha received enlightenment by following the path of Vipassana. Acharya Goenka who is a living master of Vipassana, is endeavouring very hard to spread the message of this great art of life to. I am a humble practitioner of Vipassana and I have been immensely benefited in my life.

I am an industrialist and has lot of tension & work-load. In 1994 I was in great tension due to workers unrest. I was advised by Mr. Ravi Dewang to visit Dhamma Giri at Igatpuri. I have undergone ten days Vipassana and I was really relaxed and was recharged. I felt confident and got great boosting. Since then I do Vipassana and I sent my workers & officers regularly to Dhamma Giri at Igatpuri who are greatly benefited. I feel Vipassana is the need of today.

I am very glad that I’ll share with you my experience, maybe some other human beings will get out of the addiction misery.<br/><br/>

I had addicted to use opium more than 20 years. I had given up at least ten times but it didn’t last more than two or three months. Finally I think that according to my good karma I found out about Vipassana in 1995 and I participated in a ten-day course in November 1995 and it was my privilege that my teacher was the kind and dear Mr Goenkaji. Now after two years there is nothing about craving to use opium and more than that I’ve got too many more benefits out of this technique. I do my meditation every day morning and evening and I’ve sent my wife and my daughter to do this course for their benefits.<br/><br/>

I want to thank again Guruji, Management, Assistants and the kind workers in the Igatpuri Vipassana centre.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy**<br/>

The programme was very self improving and peaceful. However if the number of participants could be increased then many more could be benefited.<br/><br/>

An advantage of participating in the programme was that a lot of my unanswered questions were clarified. If we can use this mental clarity in our area of responsibility successfully, then it will definitely go a long way in resolving a lot of our problems.<br/><br/>

After undergoing this course there will be more ......., honesty and dedication towards our work.<br/><br/>

I have learnt the art of living, its truth and advantages.

I have become free from various superstitions, religious beliefs and .......

In this entire programme one learns about oneself and develops dedication towards one's work.......................<br/><br/>

One learns to develop his inner strengths and gets confidence to live in today's tension filled world. One is cured of various internal illnesses automatically. Your inner energy and capacity for work increases. The entire programme is beneficial for administrators, govt. and public servants. In my opinion we should have more of such programs. By this not only will government officials be benefited but as a result the entire department will be benefited.<br/>

Vipassana is an important tool for self development. It is not any particular religion, it is humanism which is the basis of every religion. It helps in self development and awakens in you a feeling of good towards everyone. It increases one's capacity and efficiency at work. Every person should attend a Vipassana course. Let people from all religions take part in this camp together and be benefited. Let more such camps be organized in the future so that other officials may get the benefit.<br/>

This course has been very good for reducing tension and self improvement and the mind becomes very peaceful as a result. It is a very complete and practical technique which no science had discovered till date. It inspires one to lead a pure life and one feels that it will increase one's dakshata. We are grateful those officials who arranged this programme so that we could end our mental tension. We hope there will be more such programs in the future.<br/>

In 1984, I was introduced to this immortal and highly beneficial technique. Since then I have been associated with it. In this camp I have had a few spiritual experiences. With the help of Anapana meditation my concentration has increased, the period of concentration also has increased.<br/><br/>

By observing my bodily sensations with greater awareness, equanimity and continuity, I managed to remove my negativities to a deeper extent.<br/><br/>

Apparent benefits<br/>

- Concentration was increased

- Proper awareness was established

I was quite surprised when on reaching the Academy I was told that I would have to remain silent for 10 days and live within a limited area. I would have to observe silence quite diligently as the instructions mentioned about a stress course. So I followed the instructions of the academy having decided to undergo the course and observe all the rules .<br/><br/>

I liked the Vipassana course very much, I feel it will change a person's nature. However it should be restricted to a few persons but should be conducted on a large scale. It should especially be conducted for those in high posts and important officials so that those below them will be inspired to join the course and improve their thoughts.<br/>

The program on reducing tensions and self improvement was very good. It is my good fortune that I got an opportunity to take part in the program, for this I am grateful to my department. This program will help me a lot in the future in improving myself. It will definitely help me progress on the path to good. It will also help me be a better official.<br/><br/>

The tensions which arise during executing our daily official duties will get reduced by this program and we can perform those duties in a better way. Initially for the first 3 days I was a bit upset and tense but as the course progressed, I found some inner strength. Now after doing the course I feel grateful for being sent here against my wishes. I hope I will get a chance to do a refresher course at least once a year. I am very grateful to my department for the apparent benefits I have got from this course. I am sure I will derive many more benefits in future from this course.<br/>

I am at a loss for words to describe the benefits i have received from the Vipassana course held at the Academy of Administration, Bhopal from 15/2/97 to 26/2/97. From this course I learnt the true meaning of humanity. Apart from my personal improvement it will benefit my official duties by increasing tolerance, capacity for work, efficiency and equanimity.<br/><br/>

The high officials of the department should participate in this course and get benefited. My diabetes has been controlled to a large extent by this course. If more such courses are organized then others will also get benefited. A refresher course should be organized at least once in a year.<br/><br/>

The training programme organized by the Academy of Administration from 15/2/97 to 26/2/97 on Vipassana shivir appears to me very much useful for future working in the department. The course develops concentration of mind, self confidence and to take decision in the right direction. It will also increase the efficiency and discipline in day to day working with physical fitness.<br/>

Vipassana Meditation puts an end to negativities and lets you experience equanimity. I recommend that every government official and politician should make it a point to attend at least one course in his life. I experienced an inner joy by attending this course.<br/>

It is a technique to identify truth and falsehood, a technique which prevents one from going astray so that he may proceed on the path to experience the Ultimate truth. It keeps one away from selfishness and towards humanity. Every person should undergo this technique in order to be a better human being.<br/>
