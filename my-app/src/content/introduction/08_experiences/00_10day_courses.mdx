#### Vipassana-'know yourself by yourself for yourself'

<Divider />

**_Mr. Krishan from Delhi writes to the organiser:_**<br/><br/>

"It was indeed a heavenly experience to have attended a 10 day Vipassana camp in the picturesque surroundings and serene atmosphere of Logicstat Van, New Delhi. The food was simple, nutritious; and accommodation excellent. The co-ordinator and Dhamma-workers tirelessly looked after the meditators during these ten days with great love and care. The assistant teachers were caring and pleasantly answered the doubts and questions which clouded in the minds of the meditators. I consider this nothing short of benediction of nature that is so visible that on the parting day, each meditator was radiating bliss.<br/><br/>

A long way is to be covered on the path of Nirvāṇa and that too by each one oneself. Let us be aware and vigilant lest we get stuck up.<br/><br/>

With Guruji's blessings and the good wishes of all my elders, I could successfully complete the meditation for ten days and hope I will continue to practice the same in all its seriousness. The course has belied all my fears and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it but for certain stray moments when my mind was clouded. I believe that Vipassana is the only science that enables one to search oneself in a very systematic and scientific manner. To me, Vipassana is to "know yourself by yourself for yourself."<br/><br/>

The entire thrust of Vipassana, as I understand, is to achieve equanimity of mind, i.e. to observe things as they happen inside the body as a witness with an alert and aware mind. As a result of this one starts looking at things, events and persons more objectively which ultimately helps one to accept them as they are and to deal with them with a calm and quiet mind. The real test of one's equanimity is how one transacts in the outside world. With Vipassana, the whole attitude towards life changes.<br/><br/>

I am writing to express my deep gratitude to you and to Guruji for the opportunity provided to me to attend the Vipassana course. I was deeply impressed by Guruji's discourse: one who does something for others without any expectation and feels grateful to another who does any little thing for him is a true Dhamma person. I shall try in my humble way to live by these principles . . ."<br/><br/>

#### Vipassana - A Way to a Harmonious Life

<Divider />

**_Ramesh M. Ubale_**<br/>

**Senior I.A.S. Officer**<br/><br/>

Due to over work and stress I started getting chest pain in the year 1984-85. I consulted various doctors, Dr. Dhananjay Gunde from Kolhapur introduced me to the Art of Vipassana and I attended my first course at Igatpuri in 1985, under the audacious guidance of Shri Satyanarayan Goenka. That was the turning point in my life. Initially I joined this course out of curiosity. After the completion of the course I realized that this is the only way of scientific meditation which will keep each and every one of us free from all complications of life and will bring harmony in our relations.<br/><br/>

I am totally convinced that before going to any doctor for minor illness as well as psychosomatic disorders one should try this course which will definitely help to recover from such problems.<br/><br/>

After 1985, I tried to convey this message to various groups of people. I was also practicing Vipassana in my daily life, but due to my preoccupied engagements I could not repeat the course till November ’96. I attended this course at Igatpuri in November ’97. I can assure any individual that this way of life does not propagate and challenge or any false promises. It is based on purely natural science, which helps a human being to "know thyself". It also helps to keep away diseases like blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension and heart problems. The persons who are engaged in all the sedimentary work are advised to do this course at least once to find out the truth of the life. I can also assure that one can practice Vipassana and at the same time be Hindu, Muslim or Christian or for that matter of any religion.<br/><br/>

Human life of today is full of competition, stress and fatigue. Specially to cope up with this kind of life and to attend noble peace of mind one must attend this course and it does not interfere in the various religious life of the practicing student.<br/><br/>

#### Vipassana: My Spiritual Pilgrimage

<Divider />

**_By Mohammed Arif Joiya_**<br/><br/>

In 1976 I went to Arogya Mandir, a nature cure institute at Gorakhpur, and benefited greatly from my stay there. In those days I also read many spiritual books and entered into religious discussions with various colleagues. All this awakened me but did not quench my thirst. On the contrary, it made me more agitated and spurred me on to a further search. I was looking for a teacher who would really make me experience the truth. I wanted to realize within myself the esoteric expressions in the form of living peace and energy. Not being satisfied with entertaining discourses, I wanted to realize and experience the truth for myself.<br/><br/>

Temples, mosques, pagodas, and gurudwara [Sikh temples] along with all the scriptures could not hold my mind. I was still overwhelmed by an empty, unsatisfied life. In such a wounded state, I opened myself and expressed my spiritual aspirations before Dr. Vithaldas Modi, founder of Arogya Mandir, and demanded a way out. He advised me to attend a Vipassana meditation course and sent me a small pamphlet and application form for Vipassana. I read and understood it, but was frightened: "Oh ! This is the religion of Buddhists, atheists. These Buddhists don’t believe in Soul and God. What can they teach ? I am a Muslim. I cannot commit this crime.’’ But my heart within again said that the advice of Dr. Modi should be obeyed. "Why should he wish ill of me ? Whatever he advises is certainly for my benefit and welfare. Let me try and see.’’ So I went to the Vipassana International Meditation Centre near Hyderabad in February 1978 to attend a Vipassana course.<br/><br/>

I arrived late but was pleased to find the place very quiet and peaceful. Mr Bachubhai Shah, who was an organizer, received me with great love and hospitality. He said, "Arifbhai, you have missed a day but I am sure that Goenkaji will accept you on the course. Don’t worry. You may take a bath and have breakfast while I go and speak to him about you.’’ I was pleased with this pure, affectionate reception and reassurance from Mr Bachubhai.<br/><br/>

While I was waiting I started looking around at the students observing Noble Silence. And I was experiencing a slight fever which I had been feeling from the moment I had stepped onto this holy land. This was the fever of some unknown fear. I felt that my ego was going to be sacrificed, and I was ready for it.<br/><br/>

Goenkaji sent for me. I went, bowed down and smiled. He and his wife were seated on chairs. He appeared to be a scientist, a doctor, or a literary person.<br/><br/>

"Come and sit down.’’I sat on the border of the carpet and smiled."What is the nature of your work ?’’ "I am a physical training teacher in Udasar, Sir.’’ "Hmmm... What is the problem ?’’ "Stammering speech, Sir. A little difficulty.’’ "Okay. It will be alright. There will be instructions in the evening. Until then observe your breath and remain aware of it.’’ "Very good, Sir.’’ "Then go,’’ he said smilingly. I bowed down, paid respects, and smilingly came out of the hall.<br/><br/>

I started thinking, ``What sort of Guru have I got ? He is a worldly person. Could there be a Guru like this ? Married ! Householder ! No beard, no mustache, clean shaven ? No marks on the forehead ? No long hair ? No ocher robes ? He had on a terylene half-sleeved shirt, and colourful checked lungi. At least he should have been wearing khadi (home -spun) cloth. Absolutely modern, very ordinary. How can he teach meditation ? Never mind, I have come, so let me try and see.’’<br/><br/>

After a short while when I, along with hundreds of meditators, started following the instructions of Goenkaji of observing and remaining aware of the breath and feeling its touch, a silent voice within me arose and whispered, "Oh ! This is exactly what I was looking for. I’ve got it. I must work hard. I’m already one day late so I should not waste a single moment.’’ I started meditating with great enthusiasm.<br/><br/>

In the evening the instructions were given. Goenkaji said: "Repeat what I say in Pāli.’’ I repeated that for the duration of the meditation course I would abstain from killing, theft, sexual misconduct, speaking lies and taking intoxicants. I liked the five precepts. But along with them I had to repeat, "I take refuge in Buddha. I take refuge in Dhamma. I take refuge in Sangha.’’ At that moment I refrained, but later there was a little discontentment in the mind. "Look, Modiji trapped me. He put me in a whole new position as if a snake has swallowed a rat. Oh ! Khan Saheb, these people have sunk your ship. Now go in your society as a Buddhist.’’<br/><br/>

At any rate, I recovered and started to observe the breath. Again the same train of thought came. But when the awareness of breath steadied a little, this problem automatically and gradually resolved itself. Now I didn’t want to think of these problems. I started progressing. During the rest period, even after finishing lunch, etc., I continued meditation. The fact that I was a day late and other meditators must be farther advanced inspired me more. I continued meditation without any other thought.<br/><br/>

A television screen started shining before my closed eyes. I very clearly perceived the shaping of dormant impurities of the mind starting to arise and pass away. It was like the dirtiest, wildest film I had ever seen. Such obnoxious prejudices appeared which made me feel like vomiting. But I understood at the same time that it was doing me good. Impurities were coming out. It was a good thing.<br/><br/>

On the fourth day Vipassana was given. A new voice arose within my heart. "I have practised this technique some time in the past. It is very simple and familiar !’’ I continued to progress from the gross to the subtle.<br/><br/>

By Day Seven I realized that this technique of meditation is so simple that any child or even an illiterate person can learn and effectively practice it. Just to observe the natural breath with closed eyes and continued awareness that it is coming in, going out, and it is touching somewhere. Continuing to observe the breath, the witnessing faculty of the mind establishes automatically. And then one has to observe objectively the sensations throughout the body from head to toe in a particular order. Sensations may be pleasant or painful. Both have to be observed with equanimity. By repeating the same process over and over again, quiet concentration of the mind and equanimity gradually increase.<br/><br/>

As I slept that night, a terrible thing happened. It was almost midnight. I saw that a very ferocious demon had seized my neck with both hands and had started shaking my head around and around and said, "Oh evil soul ! You have brought me here in this ashram ! Just wait, I will show you.’’ And with enormous force he threw my body on the ground. Along with it the very sweet voice of Goenkaji came to my ears, "Son, do not worry.Come near me. Come, do not be frightened.’’ I awoke fearful and frightened, looked around with open eyes and saw the foreign meditators who were my room-mates fast asleep.<br/><br/>

Immediately I understood that it was a nightmare. It was a play of my mind. It was a trick to force me to leave the course by any means. Impurities were being eradicated. All the torture was due to that. I came out of the room; saw the lights on and the trees standing with their branches and leaves swinging and singing, as if some quiet festival was being celebrated. I started listening and then realized, "Oh ! This is a conspiracy of the unconscious mind. I now understand. I am not leaving without completing the course.’’ I relaxed, smilingly returned to bed, and meditating while lying down, eventually went to sleep.<br/><br/>

Dawn broke. There was meditation in the hall. After lunch I was overwhelmed with another experience. I felt that my head and hands were swinging as though they belonged to someone else. I was in a very tranquil, detached, equanimous witnessing state. "Oh Gotama Buddha ! How did you discover this unique meditation technique ? You kept on teaching people this sacred art. And once again this art has become available for people’s welfare. Salutations to you, my Lord. Again and again I prostrate before your compassionate feet. Endless prostrations.’’ I now understood the meaning of "I take refuge in Buddha’’ as refuge in one’s own bodhi or enlightenment, not the personality of Siddhartha Gotama. The meaning of "I take refuge in Dhamma’’ is that one has to be established in one’s own true nature, not in any sectarian religion. The meaning of "I take refuge in Sangha’’ is to take refuge in those noble ones who have become well - established in Dhamma, whatever their race, colour or nationality. From this sacred moment onwards, the word death, full of theories and tears, just melted from the book of my life and flowed away like melted snow. Oh, no ! No being dies. Death is impossible.<br/><br/>

Everyone keeps on moving on the journey according to one’s own actions. And the final destination of the journey is nirvana. Now I understood what one’s own religion is and what the religion of others is. Without purifying the mind of impurities by Vipassana and realizing our own nature, life is lived in the religion of others. Living in one’s own nature is Svadharma, the true Dhamma.<br/><br/>

On the ninth day a new meditation technique was taught -- the technique of metta bhavana whereby one shares one’s own merits with beings all around. This meditation filled me with love and compassion and made me cry.<br/><br/>

When I came out of the course I felt that I had no enemies. All were my relatives. My mind was filled with love, compassion and sympathetic joy towards everyone. I thought that I must have performed some good action in a past life, and as a consequence of that I was born in the lap of the affectionate and compassionate Mother-India: salutations to you, Mother-India. Now I really understood why India is designated as the "world teacher." A sort of pride arose in me to be an Indian. I felt one with all created beings of the earth.<br/><br/>

Now the only religion for me is to help miserable people to be free of their miseries: may all beings walk on the path of pure Dhamma; may all be religious in the true sense of the term. By adopting the practice of Vipassana I have found the right direction in life and this has made life worthwhile. The path is long but it becomes straight and easy.<br/><br/>

Vipassana has naturally helped me to come out of bad habits. It has given me the strength to smile in desperate situations. It has also given me the strength to discharge my responsibilities. I feel less nervous. Day by day I am gaining strength to address bigger and bigger audiences. My life was incomplete without Vipassana.<br/><br/>

I would like to tell my young educated Muslims that they should really try Vipassana and see the results. It is a necessity today that people of all different walks of life unite. By escaping from harmful sectarianism they can help establish a really strong national unity. Vipassana is the only solution to all the problems of mankind, because it is universal and it gives such positive fruits.<br/><br/>

I bow my head down to my teacher Shri Satya Narayan Goenka and assistant teacher Dr Vithaldas Modi.<br/><br/>

**Salutations to Dhamma !**<br/>

#### Vipassana and Cricket

<Divider />

**_Mr Bishen Singh Bedi,_** <br/>
**Sportsman, Delhi**<br/><br/>

As Mr. S. N. Goenka said in the morning, most of us sitting here are from the kindergarten. I would like to think myself a mere toddler as far as this technique of meditation is concerned.<br/><br/>

So far as I can recollect, ever since I discovered myself, I have never done anything except playing cricket and even today my life revolves around cricket, and that in very simple words is Dharma for me.<br/><br/>

Cricket is a way of life and I see so much similarity with Vipassana. Both involve applying a fairly consistent amount of concentration and effort over a period of time. When we say that someone is not playing cricket, it means that he is not being fair in life, he is not upright, he is not honest.<br/><br/>

If I may cite an example, it is a quote from the late Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies, who once said: "If only America and Russia played cricket, this world would be a much happier place to live in."<br/><br/>

I was talking to Mr Tandon, who first introduced me to this technique, and I said, whatever you are trying to teach us here—well I have already done a three-day course and I am going for a ten-day course in July—I call this a "psyching process", to peak up yourself at the right moment. I had many limitations with my own cricketing ability and I can tell you—people like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev—how they psyched themselves up for their performance, and then had pride in their personal achievements. When I say "pride", that should not be taken in a sense of conceit or arrogance. This "pride" means satisfaction at your personal performance. If you are not proud of yourself, I am afraid, nobody else is going to be proud of you. And this personal pride should be followed by something called national pride.<br/><br/>

Personally I have learnt life is a never- ending process of learning, and I have learnt from Vipassana that I can introduce this technique to little kids whom I am training from the age group of ten to fifteen years: to improve concentration, to inculcate some kind of belief in their own ability and some kind of discipline which cricket requires for the betterment of their own personality and for the betterment of society in which they are going to grow up. And also if I may say so, to eliminate the possibility of ball tampering, betting and bribery. I am sure, this technique would help to a great extent.<br/><br/>

#### A Catholic Priest on Vipassana

<Divider />

**_Fr. Peter Lourdes_**<br/><br/>

In February 1986, I attended a ten-day course in Vipassana offered by S. N. Goenka at the Vipassana International Academy (VIA) at Igatpuri. Igatpuri is about three hours by train from Bombay.<br/><br/>

With me was a group of 4 Catholic priests, 2 brothers and 28 sisters. A priest and two sisters from my staff also joined me. I programme and direct a six-month course for Formators (church personnel in charge of the training of future brothers, sisters and priests). The Unit on spirituality calls for an experience of other forms of spirituality respected in this part of the world. All of us were part of this experience.<br/><br/>

I am a religious priest with a degree in psychology from Rome and Ph. D from Loyola University of Chicago. My doctoral thesis was in The Implications of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) Programme for Counselling Psychology. In a course in Comparative Mysticism at Loyola, I was asked to present TM to the class. My background in psychotherapy, comparative mysticism, TM and my personal life in a religious order was a tremendous asset during my Vipassana days in VIA. I seem to have touched something I was looking for over the years. I returned to Pune and continued Vipassana together with a religious group whom I am Spiritual Director.<br/><br/>

At Igatpuri I met Laurie Ross whose involvement in Vipassana impressed me. In the meditation hall one thing that struck me was the stillness with which she sat in an unchanged posture for hours. I could not do that much. She told me later that this was her thirteenth course in Vipassana.<br/><br/>

People who know I am a priest sometimes wonder what a Catholic priest is doing in a Buddhist Centre! Roger Corless of Duke University reports that Thomas Merton remarked he felt more in tune with D. T. Suzuki (Zen Buddhist) than with the average Catholic mass-goer. I am no Merton, but I felt the same in Igatpuri and often feel so in my ministry. Spirituality has been a life-long quest for me. I have dared to search for it in waters outside the Bark of Peter.<br/><br/>

How does that square with my Catholic affiliation ? I think Vipassana is one way of reaching the goals of the mystical spirituality of my Catholic tradition.<br/><br/>

My Catholic tradition also has a theological side to it. That is the side, which is usually transmitted to us from conventional catechisms, church-going, family upbringing, preaching and so on. The theory (or theology if you will) of the Vipassana technique does not generally fit my Catholic theological world view. But I do not think that is very important.<br/><br/>

The reason why I do not think it important is this: I consider my Christian theology just one way of interpreting and talking about transcendent experience. I think the experience is more important than the way of talking about it. In the experience, I feel closer to the mystics of our Christian tradition, to those of our Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist tradition, than to our theologians and mass-goers.<br/><br/>

In my Christian tradition, I think, the "theological spirituality" was more dominant than the mystical one. I seem to find that in Goenka’s variety of spirituality, the mystical is all. It reaches out so heart-warmingly to the really Real and will not settle for anything less.<br/><br/>

Does not the Christian tradition have the same heart-warming thrust? I believe it does, but it does not seem to have a simple and clear-cut method like Vipassana. Whatever methods it had may have died with the monasteries.<br/><br/>

Where I am at present in my spiritual journey, I feel hungry for the ineffable God of our humanity rather than the talked-about God of our theology and Sunday School.<br/><br/>

Although I do not wish to be Messianic, I often feel sad I cannot make all my fellow Christians interested in the mystical dimensions of our common human thirst for the Beyond.<br/><br/>

I invite all of you to join all human beings and me in an attempt to hear and march to a different drum right within the rank and file of our own religious groups or outside.<br/><br/>

#### Universal Vision of Learning

<Divider />
***Khursheed Merchant***
<br />
<br />

Though affected greatly by the ten-day course I did in 1984, sad to say, I did not pursue the practise. Fortunately in 95’ Madhusudan More revived my enthusiasm. I attended a four-day course with Dr Asha Kapadia followed by another ten-day course. Needless to say I am benefitting immensely. I am a much quieter, wiser, and more fulfilled person.<br/><br/>

In my coaching in the Empowerment Programmes, I lead here and abroad, I am far more effective as I am able to bring sharper distinctions of the mind in focus from the insights I’ve had in my Vipassana practise. I recommend it as a most fruitful practice in all my courses.<br/><br/>

#### Blessing in Disguise

<Divider />

We have all heard the saying: blessing in disguise, but may not have experienced its true meaning in our lives. In the year 1997, I found myself in circumstances that made me realize what truly is a blessing in disguise!<br/><br/>

At that time I was not doing well in any aspect of life. I had been through different therapies and nothing seemed to work for me. The amount of restlessness and anxiety I carried with me made it impossible to have a moment of peace. I always had to be doing something; being by myself and doing nothing was terrifying. My relationships with others involved a lot of lying and anger and since that is all I had to give that is all I received in return. There were exceptions of course-people who were kind to me regardless of how I acted towards them. I used to feel a ball of burning fire inside of me that was constantly releasing toxins into the system and I lived with the fear of this fireball bursting one day and getting me and others into a lot of trouble. I also had a strong desire to search for a way out of this unhappiness and so I looked and searched everywhere for that way, but the way was nowhere to be found! I did come across a lot of intellectual advice, but I was just too miserable to derive any benefit from it.<br/><br/>

It was in this frame of mind that one fine day I found myself on the inside of Tihar jail in New Delhi, India, a place not well known for bringing out the best in human beings. Now there was no end to my misery, my worst nightmare had come true. I was actually confined inside a physical boundary and could not move about as I pleased. Just when I thought things could not get any worse for me, they did and I landed in a ten-day Vipassana Meditation course, where not only was I confined to an even smaller physical boundary, but I also had to sit for hours without moving or speaking! Now my misery knew no bounds.<br/><br/>

But there is a small story as to how I came to be in that meditation course. While living in jail I got this idea that I should teach others meditation. I had learned and read up on all kinds of meditation practices and used to consider myself an expert; and so I talked to the officials and impressed them with my knowledge of meditation and requested that I be allowed to teach others. One of the officials kindly suggested that there was already a place in the jail where they teach meditation and perhaps I should go and check it out first. And so I went to this place and was surprised to meet smiling and happy faces, which impressed me enough to try this meditation myself. I did not realize what I was getting myself into!<br/><br/>

My desire to find peace and harmony got a big jolt as soon as I was introduced to the timetable of the course, and by Day Two whatever peace and harmony I had, slowly left me and I was left with pains of a type I had never experienced before. I wanted to run away but felt ashamed to do so, for I had impressed the jail officials regarding what a great meditator I was. If I ran away now they would laugh at me and I was not about to let that happen. So I was doomed to suffer and suffer I did. As the days passed, the object of my meditation changed from observing respiration to just managing to stick around the meditation hall. Any time I did not do so there were these people whose sole responsibility was to track down meditators like myself and bring them back to the hall of suffering. They never missed their target, which just happened to be me most of the time.<br/><br/>

So there I was, suffering one day after another and hoping for the thing to be over for me so I could get on with my life and never come back to this place. I would go to the teacher and complain about the pain and he would encourage me to observe it with equanimity, which I thought I was doing anyway, but with a constant desire to be rid of it! To me awareness and observation were one and the same thing. I did not understand the possibility of being aware of pain without wishing for it to go away, which I later found out is called observation with equanimity-what the teacher meant.<br/><br/>

Like this, nine days passed and nothing happened, or so I thought! On the ninth day during the last sitting before lunch, something happened that turned my world upside down-or rather right side up! All of a sudden the ball of fire I used to feel inside got punctured and lava started pouring out of it and it got so heavy that the whole place could hear my loud breathing. It was unbelievable-the stuff that was coming out of it and how I was relaxing as it emptied out. I opened my eyes several times during the sitting to see if it was really happening, and every time I opened them, the world seemed less and less threatening, as if everything has been okay all this time and only I perceived it to be bad. I cried like a baby out of joy, but mostly out of relief, my body and mind had never felt so light and at peace. Then the whole thing started to make sense and I understood the reason why I had come to Tihar Jail.<br/><br/>

It has been a journey since that day and everything has changed for the better. Life finally has a sense of purpose and direction. What I experienced in my first course seemed at that time to be a one-shot deal, an end of sorts for suffering, but actually it was just the first small step, for suffering has very deep roots. The good part is that every step brings an extra bit of relief, which one clearly feels in one's life, motivating one to continue. Finally, I have found something that actually works for me-slowly, but surely!<br/><br/>

One reason why I feel I have benefited from Vipassana is that I have always been open to learning things that make sense to me, regardless of who is teaching them. I feel that a true searcher should be open to accepting Truth for Truth's sake alone, and not allowing any personal baggage to come in the way. With this thought may all who read these words find happiness in life. May all beings be happy.<br/><br/>

#### My Vipassana Experience: Peace Within a Prison

<Divider />

_(Kelvin Thompson is an inmate of Yerwada Central Jail, Pune. A 32-year old chemist from London, Kelvin sat his first Vipassana course in March 97 the second Vipassana course conducted in Yerwada prison. This interview was on Day 10, the Mettā Day)._ <br/><br/>

"I left London in September 1993. I reached India and this problem started (alleged possesion of drugs). I was in Arthur Road Jail, Mumbai, until my case came up for hearing in July 1995. Then I was put in Yerwada here.<br/><br/>

The DIG (Deputy Inspector General, Mr. D. N. Dawne) here told me about this Vipassana course. 'Do this course and you will get peace of mind,' he said.<br/><br/>

I am looking for peace of mind. The situation here is getting desperate, real bad. I'm here stuck inside this prison. I may be here for how long, who knows. I want to see my parents, my wife Adeline, my daughter. I can't do that.<br/><br/>

I took the 10-day Vipassana course. I thought a miracle will happen. But now I know what happens is according to the laws of nature. This is a wonderful technique. I am more happy now. But miracles have nothing to do with it. It's hard work.<br/><br/>

At first I thought, 'What have these sensations got to do with my problems? What's it got to do with my miseries, to being locked up inside this prison?'<br/><br/>

Then I began realizing how what was happening. Any sensation that arose in my body with my thoughts - pain, heat, itching - I would just observe it without reacting. It would arise, it would pass away. Why should I be reacting to something that was so impermanent? No sensation lasts forever.<br/><br/>

Now when thoughts of anger arise, I could see what was happening to my body - my breath became hot, for instance. Earlier I used to hit out, rage for hours. Now I become calm in about 20 minutes. I am becoming calmer.<br/><br/>

Now I can see that my problems are not caused by other people. The problems are within me.<br/><br/>

Vipassana is a very different technique, you know. It strikes at the root of our problems and cuts it out. It's very practical. My friends and I first thought, 'What's this? No God? No religion?.' We suspected we were being converted to Buddhism. Then we realized it was nothing of that kind. My brother, this is essence of all the goodness in all the religions. And this is not just preaching or blind belief. This is a technique anyone can practice.<br/><br/>

I could understand Vipassana much more easily because of my scientific background. In the lab, we purify chemicals from its impure state to a refined, ultra pure state. I think this is what I have been through. I have been through a mental purification. I don't think all my problems have gone. It cannot happen in just ten days. But what has gone has left me feeling much lighter. I am not the same person I was ten days ago. I am at peace."<br/><br/>

(*At a press conference, a few hours later, Kelvin Thompson and fellow inmates again spoke about their experience with their first Vipassana course. The Inspector General of prisons, Mr. Narawane, announced that Yerwada Jail will have regular Vipassana courses from now. The Maharashtra Government has already ordered that every prison in the state organize Vipassana courses for its inmates*).<br/><br/>

#### Way of Life

<Divider />

"I have to say first that taking part in a Vipassana course was the most painful thing I've ever done to myself, but the most amazing. The feeling I had when I left was one of empowerment. I had an overwhelming feeling of being able to deal with ANYTHING that came my way-be it good or bad. Even though there are times when you are on a high, and you think nothing can touch you, never does that feeling sustain itself. But now I feel that everything is insignificant compared to my ability to recognise the situation, accept it, and learn from it. Most of all, I feel light and glowing.<br/><br/>

It was a treacherous process, however. Day 1 and 2 were the worst. I wanted to run away. I couldn't find a reason to be there. There was a flipchart that alerts you to the course day number, and it felt like Day 2 went on for months! I was hallucinating for 3 days, and then the emotional roller coaster started: depression, happiness, fear, agitation, bliss, excitement. Once I was able to watch my emotions objectively, I balanced out and that's when the good feelings started. But the first four days were heart wrenching to say the least. The discourses at night kept me going, as did the advice of a Vipassana teacher before the course who told me that when I felt like running away, I should just say to myself, "Let's see what happens tomorrow." So in the end, curiosity got the better of me! Day 10 was a very love-filled day. The anticipation of being able to talk, the knowledge that the morning meditation was going to be your last chance to develop in the technique, the bonding of spirits after silence was broken, the sharing of experiences and thoughts-it was truly wonderful. On that day, I made friends with people from all over, people that I continue to keep in touch with. Then there was the beauty of Day 11. Knowing that we would not feel the energy of the Dhamma Hall in the near future caused us to linger there, something we would not have done in the first week! And the final mettā was filled with such compassion, men and women alike couldn't help but weep. Naturally, I thought of many people who might benefit from the technique. Although I recommend this to everyone, I feel that one cannot go to a Vipassana course thinking it's going to be a remedy for a specific loss or pain or sickness. You can only get full benefit if you feel that you can accept the technique as a way of life, as a method to improve your general happiness. Also, you have to be fully committed to it-this commitment can only come from somewhere inside you. No one can convince you to do it. I cannot believe how internally happy I am, how much energy I feel, and how motivated I am."<br/><br/>

#### A Special Experience

<Divider />

"My lower limbs are lifeless below the knees because of childhood polio and I have to use artificial boots and crutches. With the support of my parents, I have been able to live a fairly independent life and am presently studying in T.Y.B.A. In spite of my best efforts, including intensive physiotherapy, there has not been much improvement in the condition of my legs.<br/><br/>

"I sat for a ten-day Vipassana course from 18th February to 1st March 2001 at Dhamma Giri. My goal was to gain strength of mind. Initially it was very painful but on the sixth day, I started to experience a sensation of 'free flow' in my legs. It was a priceless moment for me to feel this slow-moving flow of sensations in my apparently lifeless legs. I will be forever grateful to revered Goenkaji for bringing this invaluable technique back to India."<br/><br/>

#### My Ten Days with Vipassana

<Divider />

**_By Dr. V. B. Athavale_**<br/><br/>

The first time I heard of Vipassana was in December 1986. When Dr Chokhani phoned me, I agreed immediately to attend the conference and the course for 2 reasons:<br/><br/>

1. Having knowledge of Sanskrit, the word "Vipasyana" appeared to be meaningful and attractive-to observe in a special way.

2. Jidnasa: curiosity to know and learn something new also attracted me to join the course.<br/><br/>

All of you who were present at the Inauguration of the International Conference will remember the following incident. While Goenkaji was delivering his inaugural address, a person came rushing to the dias with intention of attacking him with blows. However, he remained undisturbed, kept quiet for a few seconds and then started chanting Tera Mangal, Tera Mangal, Tera Mangal Hoya Re (May You Be Happy, May You Be Happy...).<br/><br/>

Later on, we learned that this person was insane and was brought by his father with the idea that he might get cured by the spiritual powers of Goenkaji. We have all heard similar stories about Buddha and other saints like Tukaram; however it is a rare opportunity to witness such episodes-one has to experience it to believe it.<br/><br/>

Diet: Most of us have the habit of munching frequently throughout the day. Before joining the course, I was aware that we would be having our lunch as usual, but that the evening food would be light. Like many others I tended to overeat during lunch so that I could compensate for the light evening meal. After 2 days I realised that after having lunch I felt sleepy, while an alert mind was essential for proper meditation. Thus I was convinced that the dietary regime followed during the course was ideal for both physical and mental health.<br/><br/>

Silence: Though I was apprehensive initially about my ability to control my tongue, within 24 hours I was convinced that the number of thoughts encroaching on the mind are drastically reduced by maintaining silence. This in turn helps one to follow the instructions in a more effective manner.<br/><br/>

Posture: Though no particular posture was prescribed, on the first day itself I realised that sitting with knees flexed in one posture, even for five minutes, was a difficult task as my knees started aching. I continued my practice with extended knees. After a few days of practice, I realised that I could sit with knees flexed for longer and longer periods. The only trick which worked was to ignore the aching knees and a determination that if others could sit in a similar posture, why should I not be able to achieve it for longer periods.<br/><br/>

Concentration On Natural Breathing: In different types of meditation, different targets are set for fixing the mind: for example pictures of gods, or chanting a mantra like om. As breathing is a natural process and is a constant companion, one does not have to depend on external objects for focusing one's mind. One can continue one's meditation while walking or carrying on one's routine work; for example, while driving one can easily focus on breathing instead of keeping one's mind occupied in useless thoughts.<br/><br/>

Concentrating On Body Sensations: Focusing one's mind on small areas of different parts of the body with awareness of the natural body sensations is again convenient because, like respiration, our body is a constant companion. The human body is composed of the same basic constituents as all objects in the universe. Hence, by focusing the mind on any part of the body, realising its intricacies would naturally reveal the mysteries of the Law of Nature. In addition, directing one's mental energy to different organs of the body is one of the ways of improving the health of these organs.<br/><br/>

Goenkaji's Discourses: By giving examples from day to day life and stories of saints like the Buddha, the principles of philosophy are imprinted on everyone's mind.<br/><br/>

Universal Friendship Meditation: The course ends with a short session on the importance of universal friendship. During this meeting I was reminded of the Inaugural Session. The practical demonstration was given by Goenkaji himself. He considered his attacker as his friend and blessed him.<br/><br/>

The entire course was conducted in the peaceful and serene atmosphere of Dhamma Giri. At the end of the course, everyone emerged as a better person and with a changed outlook of life.<br/><br/>

When I joined the course, I only knew the literal meaning of the word Vipasyana. At the end of the course, I realised that rather than having tons of theoretical knowledge, it is better to have a pinch of experience. The sweet memories still linger on in my mind and have dragged me to the present course. So I am here with you all today.<br/><br/>

#### On the Path

<Divider />

**_-(Jean)_**<br/><br/>

Life prior to Vipassana was difficult for me.<br/><br/>

I was angry, anxious, self-pitying, unforgiving. I had spent many years living with an alcoholic on whom I blamed all my problems. And although to all outward appearances I seemed to be coping, my mind was filled with despair. I wanted what I couldn't have and was angry at the way my life had turned out. I was "suffering."<br/><br/>

I came to Vipassana through my son. At 59 years of age, I didn't think there was much my children could teach me. Little did I know that my son was to give me such a great gift. I thought that I had given him the gift of life and now, here he was, giving it to me. He had traveled to India and done some volunteer work for the summer, and afterward did a ten-day Vipassana course before returning home. He spoke frequently and fervently of his time meditating at DehraDun and gave me the book The Art of Living to read. I decided that I needed a copy for myself and wrote to order one. With the book came a list of reading material and, as I became more intrigued, I wrote to Dhamma Dipa for more information,<br/><br/>

eventually taking the giant step of registering for a ten-day course. I think my son became a little concerned at this point and reminded me over and over again of the 4:00 a.m. wake-up time, the ten hours of meditation a day, and most of all the necessity to keep silent for nine days. I must admit this last point caused me a little concern, as I am someone who loves to chatter.<br/><br/>

I was very hesitant when the big day arrived. I had visions of being encamped with a group of hippies, New Age travelers and young people. The smiling young girl who greeted me on arrival soon dispelled all my silly preconceived notions, and in looking around the registration hall I saw people of all ages and descriptions. I felt comfortable from the first day.<br/><br/>

My "cellmate," as I liked to refer to the woman who shared my room, was as intent as I on getting the most out of those ten days so there was no problem with rule-breaking chatter. In fact, this was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the ten days ... no need to converse unnecessarily.<br/><br/>

It wasn't easy. I never thought I'd be able to sit comfortably, no matter which position I adopted or however many cushions I used. I experienced a lot of pain in my legs, and standing up after one hour was pure agony. The period when we had to sit for two hours almost finished me off. But then, after several difficult days of trying to meditate, something happened. I woke one morning eager to get to the meditation hall. I was the first to arrive. I sat absorbing all the energy, all the mett, all the peace. It was the start of some of the happiest days of my life. Some mornings, during rest periods, I watched the sunrise over the hills, and in the evenings I marveled at the sunsets. Every moment became special and even as these moments passed, as I learned to live in the present, accepting that everything changes, my peace grew. I have never experienced such joy as on the tenth day of the course. It was the beginning, and although stepping back into the modern world has subdued my joy somewhat, I still experience peace whenever I sit to meditate.<br/><br/>

When my children were young and asked me what I wanted for my birthday present, I always said, "Just a little peace and quiet." In those ten days at Dhamma Dipa, that is what I received.<br/><br/>

I am only a beginner; I have much to learn. In my day-to-day life it is not always easy to practice living in the present, to detach, to meditate. I am just now preparing to register for another ten-day course; I hope to go once a year. I am looking for a group to meditate with in my area on a weekly basis.<br/><br/>

Each day as I sit to meditate, whether successfully or not, I feel as if my life is changing, I am changing. I am learning and Vipassana is my teacher.<br/><br/>

I read a quotation once which begins, "Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which flows into your life." Vipassana meditation is my stream.<br/><br/>

What have I gained from practicing Vipassana? The truth about myself and the beginning of liberation from suffering (and I don't chatter nearly as much).'<br/><br/>
