_I always thought of the future--I shall work in this manner, I shall pass securing good marks but it never happened. But when I observed my breath and trained my mind to remain in the present, I realised that I must live in the present and instead for so many days I lived building false dreams about the future. I liked this aspect of the technique very much and now I shall take great efforts to surely become the master of my mind. All this time, I was a slave of my mind, thinking of the future, which was not good for me. Now, I shall observe the five precepts as taught by Goenkaji so that my life will improve. The best thing I liked was that one should always say, ‘May all beings be happy’. Everyday, I shall start my day saying, ‘May all beings be happy’ and go to sleep after saying the above sentence_. <br/>

_I also loved keeping silence because we always keep talking. Sometimes, we ourselves don’t realise what wrong we have said. But when we keep silence, then we get the strength and time to think so that we shall only talk what is good_.<br/>
**_~Translated from Hindi_** <br/><br/>

_The programme was a good experience for me, as it gave me an opportunity to make me aware of my inner feelings towards myself and towards others. It made me conscious of my being. Though tiring at times, it was good. In the course of two and a half days, I could control my emotions and anger to some extent. So if I want to have full control over my emotions and anger, I need more practise and I intend to do so. The first thing is that I could not at least sit for half an hour but now I can sit much straight as before and also I don’t need any balance. I used to get catches in my legs but now it is normal after doing this. I think that I found something new and wonderful in my life. So many years, days and months passed but I never believed or noticed that I have something in me. But now, I shall continue this till the end of my life_.<br/>

_Attending this Anapana course I have understood the incoming breath and outgoing breath and this technique is the most useful technique in my life. How much my mind wanders! My mind is now wandering less and my life has started improving_.<br/>
**_~Translated from Hindi_** <br/><br/>

_In these three days, I learnt Anapana Meditation. I developed concentration of my mind and learn four things viz. Karuna (compassion), mudita (sympathetic joy), samta (equanimity), and the importance of impermanence. By just doing this much if I am not fully satisfied, I wish to do ten-day course in future_.<br/>
**_~Translated from Marathi_** <br/><br/>

_At first when I started working, I felt quite bored and my legs started paining, head ached severely and I felt I was trapped in some great difficulty. Then I thought that my friends are also doing this course and they are all sitting silently. Are they also facing the same trouble like me or not ? Then we were instructed that those who work sincerely and seriously get the best fruits of their efforts. Then I started working seriously putting my mind in my work. I then asked my friends whether they also experienced pain and they replied that when we get the opportunity to learn something in our life then should we not take the benefit of such opportunity? I once again applied my mind fully to my work and soon the thoughts that troubled me earlier affected me lesser, the anger that I used to experience came easily under control and I became peaceful and started understanding the precepts that I had not understood earlier. However, even now, I don’t like to meditate but now I am the master of my mind, not the slave of my mind. Whatever the type of thought arises in my mind, Anapana has given me the strength to get rid of it_.<br/>
**_~Translated from Marathi_** <br/><br/>

_First we had no idea of this Anapana Sati meditation. But in these three days when we understood Anapana meditation then my friends and myself felt very happy as though after so many years our closed mind fluttered like beautiful butterflies. With this Anapana technique our mind became quite understanding. We learnt the importance of compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity, confidence, forgiving nature, humility and following the timetable. Goenkaji narrated many stories by which we learnt that meaning of life is not narrow but is very broad. By this Anapana we have learnt not to get tense and fresh thoughts have sprung in the mind_. <br/>

Excerpts from the experiences of children who attended the Children’s course at . <br/><br/>

_It was a very good experience and I have also learnt many things in these three days which I would not have learnt years sitting home.

I am thankful to everyone, the teachers, workers, and Goenkaji I promise that I will follow what is taught to me by Goenkaji_.<br/>
