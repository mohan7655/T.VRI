In August and September 2000, Goenkaji visited United Kingdom and United States after a gap of many years. Naturally, there was a lot of enthusiasm among meditators about his visit. Goenkaji undertook this tour to participate in the Millennium World Peace Summit at the United Nations and to visit various centers and cities in UK and USA for the spread of Dhamma. <br/><br/>

It was a difficult tour given Goenkaji’s age and health. However, he did not want to spare any effort for the spread of Vipassana. In this landmark Dhamma tour he reached out to meditators and Dhamma workers from Europe, USA and Canada to understand their difficulties, to give them guidance and to inspire them on the path of Dhamma. Vipassana has struck deep roots in these regions due to Goenkaji’s efforts in the eighties when he used to visit these areas almost every year. However, advancing age and increasing demand on his time in South and South-east Asia had made it increasingly difficult for Goenkaji to travel to the West in the nineties. When he undertook this tour, ignoring the difficulties of extensive travel and his health problems, the meditators in the West were overjoyed. They worked hard to make best use of his time.<br/><br/>

While speaking at the Stanford university that has given so many prominent scientists and major scientific discoveries to the world, Goenkaji explained how the Buddha was a super-scientist: How he discovered the truth about mind and matter and their interaction, the truth of suffering and the truth of happiness. He said that Buddha was not a founder of religion but a scientist who investigated the reality inside to find out the root cause of suffering and the way to happiness; and with infinite compassion gave the technique of Vipassana, of investigating reality inside and finding eternal happiness within to the humanity. <br/><br/>

The Millennium World Peace Summit began on Monday, 28 August at the United Nations General Assembly Hall. On 29 August, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan gave the inaugural address to this first ever gathering of religious and spiritual leaders in the UN. On the same day Goenkaji was among the pre-eminent religious leaders who were invited to meet Kofi Annan. Goenkaji addressed an audience of about a thousand delegates plus hundreds of observers in the session entitled Conflict Transformation that focused on the themes of religious harmony, tolerance and peaceful coexistence. "Rather than converting people from one organised religion to another organised religion," said Goenkaji, "we should try to convert people from misery to happiness, from bondage to liberation and from cruelty to compassion." In keeping with the Summit’s theme of seeking world peace, Goenkaji stressed in his speech that peace in the world cannot be achieved unless there is peace within individuals. "There cannot be peace in the world when people have anger and hatred in their hearts. Only with love and compassion in the heart is world peace attainable." <br/><br/>

An important aspect of the Summit is the effort to reduce sectarian conflict and tension. Regarding this Goenkaji said, "When there is anger and hatred within, one becomes miserable irrespective of whether one is a Christian or a Hindu or a Muslim." Similarly he said to a thunderous applause, "One who has love and compassion with a pure heart experiences the Kingdom of Heaven within. This is the Law of Nature, or if one would rather, God’s will." <br/><br/>

In summing up Goenkaji quoted the Emperor Ashoka who in one of his Rock Edicts said, "One should not honor only one’s own religion and condemn other religions. Instead, one should honor other religions for various reasons. By so doing one helps one’s own religion to grow and also renders service to the religions of others. In acting otherwise one digs the grave of one’s own religion and harms other religions as well. Concord is good. Let all listen and be willing to listen to the doctrines professed by others."<br/><br/> 

On the same day in the evening, he addressed the Harvard Business School Club of Greater New York to explain based on his own personal experience as to how Vipassana helps a businessman both in his/her business and personal life.

On Tuesday, 5 September he gave a public talk in Northampton at Smith College Chapel. He explained the practical, pragmatic, scientific, result-oriented, non-sectarian and here-and-now nature of Vipassana meditation. Like in many of his talks before he said, "Let us focus on the commonalties of all religions, on the inner core of all religions which is purity of heart. We should all give importance to this aspect of religion and avoid conflict over the outer shell of the religions, which is various rites, rituals, festivals and dogmas." <br/><br/>

On the morning of Thursday, 6 September Goenkaji gave a talk to a huge gathering of old students at VMC, Mass. in which he told them, "You all are the torch-bearers of Dhamma!
