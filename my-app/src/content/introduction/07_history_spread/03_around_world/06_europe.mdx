Mr. Goenka conducted first courses outside India in France and England in 1979. Thereafter Europe benefited regularly from Mr. Goenka's visits, during which he conducted courses and gave public talks, attracting thousands of people from many countries.<br/><br/>

The recurring memory of Mr. Goenka's visits is of him sitting on the Dhamma seat and smilingly explaining Dhamma to a questioner, with kindness, intelligence, humour and common sense. The quality that shines through all the memories of his visits to Europe is his indefatigable service to others.<br/><br/>

To date, thousands of courses have been held in European countries. The course instructions and other literature have been translated into most European languages. Annually, over 250 ten-day courses and a number of 20-day, 30-day and 45-day courses are held in Europe.

Demand for Vipassana courses is increasing throughout Europe. Irrespective of the form of government (communism or capitalism, democracy or dictatorship), there is suffering. The qualities of compassion, tolerance, morality and generosity developed through Vipassanaa meditation can provide real peace and relief from suffering. Hence Europeans of all backgrounds are adopting the practice, developing these qualities and serving others.
