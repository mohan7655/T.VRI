Mr. Goenka first visited North America in 1979 to conduct a Vipassana course in Montreal, Canada. Thereafter, Dhamma has grown steadily in both U.S. and Canada, stimulated further by Mr. Goenka’s 4-month tour in 2002. By 2017, 16 Vipassana centers and 9 non-center locations are established in North America, offering 10-day and long courses, serving thousands of students each year.

#### Courses in Correctional Institutions

<Divider />

The first Vipassana course in a jail in North America was conducted in 1997 in a low security correction facility in Seattle, Washington; followed by 20 more courses there, and one in San Francisco Jail (in 2001). Two significant courses were held in 2002 at W. E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Alabama, a maximum-security prison noted for being a violent and brutal facility, with significant benefits. The local administration there is now considering establishing a permanent Vipassana ward.<br/><br/>

Two feature films ‘Changing from Inside’ and ‘The Dhamma Brothers’ document the significant changes achieved by Vipassana in the above prisons. Research indicates that the practice of Vipassana reduces incidents of indiscipline, aggression and other anti-social attitudes in the prison and increases general psychological well-being.<br/><br/>

#### Courses for Business Executives

<Divider />

In 2002, Mr. Goenka conducted the first course exclusively for business executives and government officials in North America. Since then, executive courses have been held at several centers in North America, leading to very positive results and the spread of Dhamma in the business community. This continent has proven to be a very fertile field for the spread of Dhamma. The sizes of the Vipassana courses at both center and non-center course locations have grown larger every year and the need for new centers continues to increase.<br/><br/>
