- [Dhamma Iran](), the Vipassana center in Iran conducts regular 10 day and other courses. <br/><br/>

- In Israel, land was acquired for the first Vipassana center, [Dhamma Pamoda](), in March 2010. This historic step came after 20 years of productive effort in organising hundreds of courses in rented sites for thousands of students. The property is spread across 10 acres of land in a beautiful area, close to the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River, two hours from central Israel. Surrounding it are plantations of date palms and a nature reserve. The first 10-day course in this center was conducted in July 2014.<br/><br/>

  The African Heritage Course<br/><br/>

Vipassana is slowly gaining ground in the continent of Africa. To stimulate this further, a special course (called the African Heritage Course) was conducted at the Global Pagoda in December 2009 for African students. The 43 participants of the course came from many African countries (including countries where no Vipassana course has been held so far). The course was conducted by a female African-American teacher. After the African Heritage Course, 8 students attended the Gratitude Gathering at the Global Pagoda.
