#### Emperor Asoka

<Divider />

Two centuries after the Buddha breathed his last, Asoka became Emperor of Magadha. Driven by overweening ambition, he established a vast empire covering much of India and neighbouring countries. But one kingdom had not been brought under his sway: Kalinga, the modern-day Indian state of Orissa.<br/><br/>

Furious at its resistance to him, Asoka attacked Kalinga and subjugated it in a bloody war. Then, after the fighting was over, he saw how many innocent people had been killed and how terrible was the suffering of this once-prosperous land. Heartsick at his own actions, he would no longer conquer any kingdom by the force of the sword. <br/><br/>

It was at this time that Asoka came to know about the teachings of the Buddha and was instantly attracted. He began by studying the words of the Enlightened One. Then someone told him that knowledge of the texts was not enough to give an understanding of the real meaning of the teachings; that can come only through the development of insight, that is, vipassanā-bhāvanā, or Vipassana meditation.<br/><br/>

The best place then to learn Vipassana was at Bairath in the state of Rajasthan, where a bhikkhu named Upagupta taught. Handing over power to his subordinates, Asoka set out for Rajasthan. After 300 days, he returned to his capital, a changed man. 'Fierce Asoka' got transformed into 'Dhamma Asoka'. Now his ambition was to spread the teachings of the Buddha throughout his empire; he had been inspired by ehipassiko, the wholesome wish that others may come and see the Dhamma.<br/><br/>

Printing then was unknown but Asoka was determined to spread the Buddha’s teachings among his subjects. He gave orders to inscribe the core teachings in stone, where everyone could see. This happened little more than two centuries after the Buddha, before his original words had been altered in any way. That is why we see the pure teachings of the Buddha in Asoka’s rock inscriptions.<br/><br/>

More than mere study of the texts or theory (pariyatti), the Buddha gave importance to practice (paṭipatti). That is why the Asoka inscriptions often mention the practice of Vipassana. <br/><br/>

The Buddha took no account of religious differences, giving his teaching to all. In many cases, people who started as his staunch opponents became his most fervent supporters once they learned what he taught. In ancient India there were two communities, the samaṇas and the brāhmaṇas. The Buddha tried to unite people of all sects in the practice of Dhamma. Similarly, Asoka made no distinction between samaṇas and brāhmaṇas. He gave donations to both and encouraged others to do the same. In fact, with the practice of Vipassana, differences between the two communities began to fade and they lived together in harmony. Asoka’s reign saw no communal tension or fighting.<br/><br/>

Asoka tried to interest all communities in Vipassana. Far from being the monopoly of any one group, he showed that Vipassana belongs to all. It is universal.<br/><br/>

During the time of Emperor Asoka, the Dhamma spread widely. Again this was mainly because of the practical, applied aspect of the teaching (Dhamma paṭipatti). Several Asokan rock edicts prove this fact. Asoka must have himself experienced the beneficial results of this technique, and he propagated the Dhamma with great zeal. It was out of the volition to serve others, which develops when the mind becomes purified, that he put forth so much effort to help his subjects in both the mundane as well as the supramundane spheres. On the Pillar Edict #7 he points out two reasons why he succeeded in this.<br/><br/>

One was the rule of law and order in his kingdom (Dhammaniyamāni), but he gave more emphasis to the second reason which was the practice of meditation (nijhatiyā), the practical aspect of the Dhamma. This shows that he appreciated the fact that the practice of the Dhamma is the main reason for its spread. <br/><br/>

The Buddha sent forth his disciples, telling each to go in a different direction and offer his pure, non-sectarian teaching. The result was that the Dhamma began to spread far and wide through northern India, bringing happiness to many. People from every major system of belief came in contact with the Buddha’s teachings and changed for the better. Similarly, to bring people of all religious backgrounds to a righteous way of living, Asoka urged them to learn and develop in Vipassana. He appointed male and female teachers, both members of the Sangha and laypeople. All began to teach Vipassana throughout India.<br/><br/>

Asoka decided to establish cetiyas, or memorials to the Buddha, the length and breadth of his empire. Afterwards bhikkhus came to reside at these calm and inspiring sites, which were ideal places for the teaching of the Dhamma.<br/><br/>

Out of compassion, Asoka saw that Vipassana was taught to prison inmates so that they might be transformed. In modern times as well, prison inmates in India, Myanmar, the United States and other countries have the opportunity to change their lives through Vipassana.<br/><br/>

Asoka was instrumental in spreading the pure teachings of the Buddha as far afield as Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Europe, although in those countries the memory of the Dhamma faded. The story was different in some Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos: there the Dhamma took root with Asoka’s help and flourishes still today.<br/><br/>

It was after the Third Council, under Asoka’s patronage, fully liberated arahant monks were sent out of northern India to nine different areas to make the Dhamma available to more people. These monks were called Dhamma dūtas (Dhamma messengers). They naturally gave emphasis to the practical aspect of the Dhamma by which they themselves had become free from mental impurities. Filled with love and compassion, they attracted large numbers of people to the path of liberation. The following are the names of the elder monks (Theras) and the nine areas where they went to teach Dhamma:<br/><br/>

- **Majjhantika Thera**: Kāsmira and Gandhāra (Kashmir, Afghanistan, Peshawar and Rawalapindi in northwest Pakistan)
- **Mahādeva Thera**: Mahisamaṇḍala (Mysore)
- **Rakkhita Thera**: Vanavāsī (North Kanārā in South India)
- **Yonaka Dhammarakkhita Thera**: Aparantaka (modern northern Gujarat Kathiavar, Kachcha and Sindh)
- **Mahādhamma Rakkhita Thera**: Mahāraṭṭha (parts of Maharashtra around the source of Godavari)
- **Mahā Rakkhita Thera**: Yonakaloka (ancient Greece)
- **Majjhima Thera**: Himavanta Padesa Bhāga (Himalayan region)
- **Soṇa and Uttara Theras**: Suvaṇṇa Bhūmi (Burma)
- **Mahinda Thera and others**: Tambapaṇṇidīpa (Sri Lanka)<br/><br/>

Asoka also sent teachers to as far away as present day Syria and Egypt. He paved the way for coming generations to spread the sublime Dhamma to the entire world. His lead was followed by King Kaniśhka who sent teachers such as the Theras Kumārajīva and Bodhidhamma to Central Asia and China. From there the Dhamma went to Korea in the early 4th century A.D., and then to Japan. In India, Dhamma Universities—Takkasilā, Nālandā, Vikkamasilā, and others—developed, flourished, and attracted learned people from as far away as China. Dhamma also spread throughout Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>

Large numbers of people started practicing in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Tibet also received the Dhamma, through the service of Śāntirakshita, Padmasambhava, Atiśha, and Kamalaśhīla.<br/><br/>

Asoka had the military strength to conquer neighbouring countries and extend the frontiers of his empire. Instead he chose to expand the kingdom of Dhamma, so that people would live a good life. In doing so, he won the hearts of all.<br/><br/>

With the passage of centuries, in some countries the teachings of the Buddha did not remain in the original, authentic form as sent by Asoka. But in Myanmar, people preserved the words of the Buddha and the technique of Vipassana meditation in their pristine purity from generation to generation. At least among a few, the theory and practice were handed on from teacher to pupil in their pure form as sent by Asoka. <br/><br/>

#### Dhamma Asoka’s timeless messages on rocks:

<Divider />

"_Even in the past the kings desired that the people should grow in Dhamma. But this did not happen.It, then, occurred to me: I should cause Dhamma proclamations to be made and Dhamma instructions to be issued. Then the people will follow these strictly, elevate themselves, and grow in Dhamma. It is for this purpose that Dhamma proclamations were made by me and manifold Dhamma instructions issued. The growth of men in Dhamma has been achieved through these two means: Dhamma regulations and insight meditation. Out of these two, of little avail have been the Dhamma regulations, while much more has been accomplished through insight meditation_" <br/>
**Delhi- Topra Pillar Edict V11**<br/><br/>

"_Happiness in this world and the next is difficult to secure without love of Dhamma, utmost self-examination, utmost dread of sin, and utmost enthusiasm. By my instructions, this regard for Dhamma, as well as love for Dhamma, have grown day by day and will multiply still further. My officers too- of high and low and middle rank – act according to my instructions, and enforce their proper practice. My instructions are: to protect according to Dhamma, to dispose according to Dhamma, to make others happy according to Dhamma, and to guard others according to Dhamma_."<br/>
**- Delhi -Topra Pillar Edict 1**<br/><br/>

"_King Priyadassi honours all sects; by gifts and offerings of kinds does he honour them. But he does not value such gifts or honours so much as that the worthiness of all sects may increase.The increase of worthiness may be of several kinds, but its root lies in guarding one’s speech, that is to say, the praising of one’s own sect or the blaming of the other sects may not take place. In fact, other sects ought to be honoured in various ways. By doing so, one promotes one’s own sect and also benefits other sects; and by doing otherwise, one hurts one’s own sect and also harms other sects_."<br/>
**- Rock Edict X11**<br/><br/>

"_The practice of Dhamma is not possible for one who is devoid of good conduct_."<br/>
**- Rock Edict IV**<br/><br/>

"_There is no such gift as the gift of Dhamma, or acquaintance through Dhamma, or the distribution of Dhamma, or kinship through Dhamma._"<br/>
**- Rock Edict X1**<br/><br/>

"_There is, indeed, no better work than the welfare of all the people_."<br/>
**- Rock Edict V**<br/><br/>

"_In spite of possessing rich gifts, those who have no self-control, or purity of mind, or gratitude and firm devotion, are poor indeed_."<br/>
**- Rock edict V11**<br/><br/>

"_The beloved of Gods wishes all beings non-injury, restraint and impartiality, even in case of offensive conduct_."<br/>
**- Rock Edict X111**<br/><br/>

"_On account of these, one does not act properly – envy, anger, cruelty, hurry, indifference, indolence (and) fatigue. So you should strive that these (things) may not arise in you. And the root of all this is absence of anger and absence of hurry_."<br/>
**- Kalinga Rock Edict 1**<br/><br/>

"_These are the ways to sin, viz. fierceness, cruelty, anger, pride, envy. Let me be not ruined by these_." <br/>
**Delhi-Topra Pillar Edict 111**<br/><br/>
