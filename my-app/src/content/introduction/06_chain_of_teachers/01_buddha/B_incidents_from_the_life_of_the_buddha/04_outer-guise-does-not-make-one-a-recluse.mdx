Once upon a time the Buddha was dwelling at Pubbarāma in Srāvastī.
King Prasenjit also arrived there. After some time some ascetics
passed that way. A few of them had matted hair, a few of them were
naked and all had their bodies smeared with ash and some were
wearing different robes. The king rose from his seat in reverential
salutation to them and introduced himself to them. The ascetics gave
him their blessings and went away. Then king Prasenjit said to the
Buddha –<br />
<br />
“Venerable Sir! These ascetics are among those in this world who are
either enlightened or are established on the path of enlightenment.
The Buddha after observing their condition said” –<br />
<br />
“It is not so, His Majesty! A person does not become enlightened or
get established on the path of enlightenment merely by changing the
guise. One has to strive in the right manner to achieve this. Even
if someone finds the right path, yet a wise person has to stay with
him for a long time to know whether he is walking on the path in the
right way or not. In a short period it is not possible to know about
his true conduct. His Majesty! One's honesty or dishonesty can be
judged by his conduct and behavior only. That also is possible only
after observing his day-to-day activities for a long period”.
<br />
<br />
Only a wise person is capable of keeping a watch on his behavior
properly and not everyone.
<br />
<br />
Only in times of adversity, the fortitude of a person's mind can be
known. In the same way, a person's wisdom is known by discussion
with him for a long time.
<br />
<br />
King Prasenjit was very much impressed with this explanation given
by the Buddha and while begging forgiveness with amazement he
revealed the truth.
<br />
<br />
Venerable Sir! all these are our spies. They collect secret
information in disguise from within and also information about the
activities of the neighboring states and keep me informed. Based on
their information, I take necessary action after careful
consideration. Venerable Sir! Now, these people will take a bath,
wash away their ashes, rub scent on their bodies and after wearing
clean clothes will enjoy the five kinds of sensual pleasures.
<br />
<br />
Hearing this, the Buddha explained –<br />
<br />
“A person cannot be known by dress and adornment. One cannot know a
person by merely looking at his dress and demeanor. Wicked persons
also roam about in this world performing attractive actions with
great self-control. They are like counterfeit earrings made of clay
and coated with gold. They look outwardly beautiful but they are
inwardly impure. So, without knowing thoroughly, never believe
anybody. Merely on the basis of his outer dress and guise, only
after carefully understanding his conduct, one should believe him”.
A True Recluse
<br />
<br />
Once the Buddha was dwelling at Aswapur town in Anga state, he
addressed the monks and said:
<br />
<br />
Monks! people take some one as a recluse and when he is asked if he
is one he declares himself a recluse. So a man designated as a
recluse and who claims to be a recluse has to walk on the path
proper to the recluse. It is for that purpose that people offer him
robes, alms-food, resting-place and medicine and other useful
requisites. Their offerings become fruitful only when his
renunciation is pure, his conduct is good and his actions are
helpful in the welfare of people.
<br />
<br />
Monks! how is one not able to practice the way proper to the
recluse? So long as a recluse does not abandon his greed, anger,
enmity, contempt, cruelty, jealousy, stinginess, deceit and evil
wishes he cannot become a proper recluse. These are the stains of a
recluse, obstacles on the path of becoming a true recluse. These are
grounds for his birth in a state of deprivation. I call this kind of
renunciation a two-edged sword which rips the robe of a recluse if
it is hidden there.
<br />
<br />
Any one having such stains cannot be called a recluse even if he
wears a robe, even if he smears his body with dirt and dust or with
ash or even if he dwells in water or dwells at the root of a tree,
or if he wears the bark of a tree, or if he dwells in the open air
or if he practices continuous standing or if he keeps a fast and
takes food at intervals or if he recites the Vedas or incantations.
<br />
<br />
He will be a true recluse only if he is free from the stains
enumerated above. He will have to constantly walk on the path of
purification. Then only he will live the life of a true recluse.
<br />
<br />
Only when some one gives up the above defilements, he becomes a true
recluse. For eradicating these defilements, one should constantly
practice the path of mind purification and after getting rid of the
defilements, live a life of a true recluse.
<br />
<br />
Monks! how is one able to practice the way proper to the recluse?
<br />
<br />
When a recluse abandons his wrong view, when he drives out anger,
greed, enmity etc and becomes free from these defilements, then only
he is considered able to practice the way proper to the recluse.
Then only he can consider himself pure and liberated. Gladness
arises in the mind of such a recluse who has attained freedom from
all such mental defilements. Rapture follows gladness. The body of
such a person becomes tranquil, one whose body is tranquil feels
pleasure and one who feels pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.
He then abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving
kindness. In the same way he abides pervading second, third and
fourth quarter, above, below, around and everywhere with a mind
imbued with unbounded loving- kindness without hostility and without
ill will, imbued with unbounded compassion, sympathetic joy and
equanimity. He makes every one happy and helps every one to derive
benefit. In this way his life of a monk becomes meaningful.
<br />
<br />
Suppose, monks! there were a pond with clear, cool and potable water
with beautiful and delightful banks and a man from the east,
scorched and exhausted by hot weather, goes to the pond, quenches
his thirst and gets relief from the heat, similarly men come there
from the west, from the south and from the north and quench their
thirst and get relief from the heat. In the same way, monks, if any
one from a Kshatriya family goes forth from the home life into
homeless life, receives the Dhamma taught by the Tathāgata, enjoys
peace by practicing four Brahmavihāras such as loving-kindness,
compassion, sympathetc joy and equanimity, such a monk is
established on the right path. In the same way persons from a
Brahmin family, from a Vaisya family and from a sudra family go
forth from the home life into homeless life, practice the Dhamma
taught by the Tathāgata i.e. practice Vipassana meditation and
develop loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity,
they become true recluses. They become free from all taints, all
mental defilements and by realising for themselves with direct
knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of
mind and deliverance by wisdom.
<br />
<br />
Destruction of taints actually makes one a true recluse. He might
have come from any family or clan. That does not become an obstacle
in the path of his becoming a recluse.
<br />
<br />
Come, meditators, let us walk step by step on the path of Dhamma, be
free from mental defilements and attain our true welfare and
happiness.
