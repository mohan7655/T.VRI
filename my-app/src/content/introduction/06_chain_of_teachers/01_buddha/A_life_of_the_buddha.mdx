#### The Preparation to Become a Buddha

<Divider />

Gotama Buddha is the fourth of the five Buddhas to arise in the world-cycle which is known as a Bhadda-kappa (an auspicious
world-cycle). His predecessors were the Buddhas Kakusanda,
Konagamana, and Kassapa. There were also innumerable Buddhas who
arose in earlier world-cycles and who preached the very same
Dhamma that gives deliverance from suffering and death to all
matured beings. Buddhas are all compassionate, glorious, and
enlightened.<br/><br/>

![Sumedha-the hermit](/preparing-to-become-buddha.jpg)

A hermit by the name of Sumedha was inspired by Buddha Dipankara—so much so, that he took the vow to make all the necessary preparations to become a Buddha in the course of time Buddha Dipankara gave him his blessings and prophesied that he would become a Buddha by the name of Gotama after a lapse of four incalculable periods of world cycles plus one hundred thousand world-cycles (kappas). From then onwards, existence after existence, the Bodhisatta (future Buddha) conserved mental energies of the highest order through the practice of the ten paramitas (or paramis, virtues leading toward perfection): <br/><br/>

- **Dana-parami: Virtue in alms-giving (or generosity)**
- **Sila-parami: Morality**
- **Nekkhamma-parami: Renunciation**
- **Panna-parami: Wisdom**
- **Viriya-parami: Great effort (or perseverance)**
- **Khanti-parami: Forbearance (or patience)**
- **Sacca-parami: Truthfulness**
- **Aditthana-parami: Determination**
- **Metta-parami: All-embracing love**
- **Upekkha-parami: Equanimity** <br/><br/>

It is, therefore, a most arduous task to become a Buddha. Utmost
strength of will-power is necessary even to think of it. The
Bodhisatta’s preparatory period came to an end with the life of
King Vessantara[^1] who excelled any living being in alms-giving.
He gave away his kingdom, his wife and children, and all his
worldly possessions, for the consummation of his solemn vow taken
before the Buddha Dipankara. The next existence was in the Tusita
(celestial plane) as the glorious deva Setaketu, until he got his
release from that plane of existence and took conception in the
womb of Maya-Devi, the queen of King Suddhodana of Kapilavatthu, a
place near modern Nepal.<br/><br/>

#### Early Years

<Divider />

History tells us that in 624 B.C. King Suddhodana ruled the
kingdom of Sakya. He had two queens: the chief queen was Mahamaya
and the younger queen was Mahapajapata Gotami, the sister of
Mahamaya. <br /> <br />

When time was drawing near for her confinement, the queen
expressed her desire to go to the place of her own parents for the
event. King Suddhodana accordingly sent her there with a befitting
retinue and guards. On the way, a halt was made at the Lumbini
Grove. She descended from her palanquin and enjoyed the cool
breeze and fragrance of sal flowers. While holding out her right
hand to a branch of a nearby sal tree for a flower, all of a
sudden and unexpectedly, she gave birth to a son who was to become
the All-Enlightened Buddha. Simultaneously, the natural order of
things in the cosmos was revolutionized in many respects and
thirty-two wonderful phenomena were vivified. All material worlds
were shaken from their foundations up. There were unusual
illuminations in the solar system. All the beings of the material
planes could see each other. The deaf and dumb were cured.
Celestial music was heard everywhere, and so on. <br /> <br />
At that moment, Kaladevala, the hermit teacher of King Suddhodana,
was discoursing with the celestial beings of the Tavatimsa deva
world. He was a hermit of fame who had mastered the eight
attainments (samapattis) which gave him super-normal powers.
Learning of the birth of a son to the king in the midst of the
rejoicing in all the rupa and kama worlds, he hurried back to the
palace and desired the baby to be brought before him for his
blessings. As the king was about to place the baby before his
teacher for the occasion, a marvel took place. The baby rose into
the air and rested his tiny feet on the head of Kaladevala who at
once understood that the baby was no other than the Embryo Buddha.
He smiled at this knowledge, but cried almost immediately
thereafter, because he foresaw that he would not live to hear his
teachings, and that after his death, he would be in the
arupabrahma-loka (the immaterial planes of the brahmas) whence he
would have no relationship with any of the material planes. He
regretted bitterly that he would miss the Buddha and his
teachings.

##### Birth Of Gotama

On the fifth day, the child was named Siddhattha in the presence
of renowned astrologers who agreed that the child had all the
characteristics of a Buddha-to-be. His mother, the queen,
however, died a week after her confinement, and the child was
taken care of by his maternal aunt, Pajapati-Gotami. At the
young age of sixteen, Siddhattha was married to Yasodhara, a
beautiful princess. It was his father’s hope that she would bind
him to the family life. Until the age of twenty-nine he lived
the life of a householder amidst great luxury and ease and
culture. He was acclaimed to be a prodigy in both intellect and
strength. The king spared no pains to make the course of his
life smooth. Three separate palaces were built to suit the three
seasons (hot, cold, and rainy) with all the necessities that
would make the prince sink in sensuality. That was because the
king, out of paternal affection, desired his son to remain in
worldly life as a king rather than become an Enlightened Buddha.
King Suddhodana was ever watchful that his son should be in an
environment that would give him no chance for higher
philosophical ideas. In order to make sure that the thoughts of
the prince would never turn in this direction, he ordered that
nobody serving him or in his association was ever to speak a
single word about such things as old age, sickness, or death.
They were to act as if there were no unpleasant things in this
world. Servants and attendants who showed the least sign of
growing old, weak, or sickly were replaced. On the other hand,
there was dancing, music, and enjoyable parties right through,
to keep him under a complete shade of sensuality.<br/><br/>

#### The Great Renunciation

<Divider />

As days, months, and years passed, however, the monotony of the
sensual surroundings gradually lost their hold over the mind of
Prince Siddhatta. The mental energies of virtue conserved in all
his earlier innumerable lives for the great goal of Buddhahood
were automatically aroused. At times, when the world of sensuality
lost control over his mind, his inner self worked its way up and
raised his mind to a state of purity and tranquility with the
strength of samadhi (concentration) such as had raised his baby
form into space and onto the head of Kaladevala. The war of nerves
began. An escape from sensuality and passion was his first
consideration. He wanted to know what existed outside the walls of
the palace, for he had not gone out even once. He wished to see
Nature as it is and not as man has made it. Accordingly, he
decided to see the royal park, outside the palace walls. On the
way to the park, in spite of the precautions taken by the king to
get the roads clear of unpleasant sights, he saw an old man bent
with age on the very first visit. Next he saw a sick person in the
agony of a fatal malady. Thereafter he met with a human corpse. On
the last trip he came across a monk. All these predisposed his
mind to serious thinking. His mental attitude was changed. His
mind became clear of impurities and tuned up with the forces of
his own virtues conserved in the sankhara-loka (the plane of
mental forces). By then, his mind had become freed from
hindrances, was tranquil, pure, and strong. It all happened on the
night when a son was born to his wife, a new fetter to bind him
down. He was, however, immune to anything which would tend to
upset the equilibrium of his mind. The virtues of determination
worked their way for a strong resolve, and he made up his mind to
seek the way of escape from birth, old age, suffering, and death.
It was midnight when the solemn determination was made. He asked
his attendant Channa to keep his stallion Khanthaka ready. After a
parting look at his wife and the newly born babe, Prince
Siddhattha broke away from all the ties of family and of the world
and made the Great Renunciation. He rode across the town to the
river Anoma, which he crossed, never to return until his mission
had been achieved. <br/><br/>

#### In search of truth

<Divider />
![in-search-of-truth](/0015.jpg) ##### The Journey to Magadha

Prince Siddhattha crossed the river Anoma, took the robes of a
recluse and proceeded towards Magadha. He was new to the life of a
monk. Close to Anupriyā village, there was a mango orchard.
Staying there for a week, he experienced for the first time the
happiness of monk-hood. To learn meditation, he decided to go to
the teacher named Alara Kalama (Ālāra Kālāma). <br /> <br />
From Anupriyā village, he went straight to Rajgir (Rajagaha, the
capital of Magadha kingdom). On the main street of the city, he
started walking from house to house for alms. The people were
impressed by his radiant face and long-limbed (ājānubāhu) body.
They had never seen such an attractive monk. Whoever saw him kept
gazing at him.<br /> <br />

The king of Magadha also couldn’t contain himself when he saw the
monk on his alms round from his balcony. He felt that this monk was not an
ordinary person. So he asked his men to follow the monk. They saw that as soon
as the monk received enough alms-food, he went to the Pandu cave on the
outskirts of the city, sat on a stone and started eating.<br /> <br />

Prince Siddhattha had never seen, let alone eaten, such dry and
tasteless food as he received on his first alms round. He ate the food with
fortitude. The king’s men told King Bimbisara what they had seen. The king
decided to go and meet the young recluse. By then the monk had finished his
meal. The king saluted the recluse and asked him,
_‘You seem to be a youth from the noble class. Who are you?’_

<br /> <br /> The young recluse said that he was the son of the king from a
republic in Kosala from the Himalayan Tarai region. He belonged to the Sun
Dynasty and was Sakyan by birth. <br /> <br /> King Bimbisara at once understood
that the recluse was the son of the Sakyan king, Suddhodana, from the Kosala
Empire. The king thought that he might have become a recluse due to a quarrel
with his family. He offered the recluse a part of his kingdom. The monk prince
declined his offer. He said that he had become a monk because he wanted to
experience the truth which is beyond all realms. He was determined to attain
this goal. Therefore he could not accept King Bimbisara’s offer. <br /> <br />
King Bimbisara was greatly impressed by the strength of his resolution. He requested
the monk to come to Rajagaha to give him a discourse once he attained enlightenment.
The ascetic prince agreed and proceeded on his way.

---

##### Ālāra Kālāma

After this Great Renunciation, Prince Siddhattha went around in
search of possible teachers in the garb of a wandering ascetic
with a begging bowl in his hand. He placed himself under the
spiritual guidance of two renowned Brahman teachers, Alara and
Uddaka. Alara laid stress on the belief in the atman (soul) and
taught that the soul attained perfect release when freed from
material limitations. This did not satisfy the prince.

---

##### Uddaka Ramputta

After learning the seventh jhāna (dhyāna, concentration,
absorption) in Alara Kalama’s meditation centre, the ascetic
prince proceeded to the meditation centre of Uddaka Ramputta where
he learned the eighth jhāna within a very short period.<br /><br />

The eighth jhāna is the meditation of nevasaññānāsaññāyatana. After the seventh
akiñcana jhāna, in the next jhāna, perception (saññā, the evaluating faculty of mind)
becomes so feeble that it is difficult to differentiate whether it is present or
absent. Saññā does the work of identification and evaluation. In this state whom
to identify? What nomenclature to give to what state? To what can we term as infinite
sky or infinite consciousness or nothingness (sunya). This state is beyond all this
and cannot be named. Saññā becomes unable to recognize any object. However, the meditator
is not totally without saññā. In this state, it cannot be said whether saññā is present
or absent. <br /><br />

Passing through the experience of this eighth jhāna, the Bodhisatta found that it
is the highest formless state of existence, that is, arūpa brahmaloka. This is the
highest amongst all existences in the cycle of life and death. Taking birth in the
arūpa brahmaloka enables one to live a long life of thousand of eons. But this state
is not immortal. Even though it is the highest, it is still a mortal existence. It
is the territory of Mara and it is not free from his clutches. The cycle of life
and death is still in motion here. This does not grant one the state of total cessation
of misery. <br /><br />

Uddaka, who emphasized too much the effect of kamma (volitional actions) and the
transmigration of the soul. Both could not get out of the conception of “soul,” and
the prince ascetic felt that there was something else to learn.

---

##### Journey to Uruvela

The Bodhisatta wanted to experience the reality of going beyond
all existences, the state that is permanent, eternal, deathless
and immortal. He wanted to find the way out of all misery, the
misery of life and death. For this he had to attain omniscience,
which would enable him to understand why beings suffer and the way
out of all suffering. <br />

With these auspicious thoughts, the Bodhisatta proceeded towards Uruvela which was
a very suitable place for meditation. <br /><br />

By that time, of course, he had learned the eight attainments (samapattis) and had
become adept in the exercise of all the super-normal powers including the ability
to read events of many world cycles to come and a similar period of the past. These
were all in the mundane field, and they did not much concern the prince ascetic,
whose ambition had been an escape from this mundane field of birth, suffering, and
death.<br /><br />

He was joined later by five ascetics, one of whom, Kondañña by name, was the
astrologer-palmist who definitely foretold on the fifth day after his birth that
he would surely become a Buddha. These ascetics served him well throughout the six
years during which he was engaged in fasting and meditation, subjecting himself to
various forms of rigorous austerities and discipline till he was reduced to almost
a skeleton. In fact, one day, he fell down in a swoon through exhaustion. When he
survived this condition, he changed his method, followed a middle course, and found
the way to his Enlightenment was clearer. <br /><br />

#### Sujata’s Porridge

<Divider />

Senani was a rich man from a village named Sena in Uruvela’s
forest area. Sujata (Sujātā), his daughter, had immense faith in a
tree-deity. She was certain that her successful marriage to a
businessman of Varanasi was because of the blessings of this
tree-god. She also felt that the birth of her son twenty years ago
was also due to the blessings of this tree-deity. So every year
she returned home to worship the tree-deity on the full moon night
of Vesāka.<br /> <br />

This year Sujata prepared delicious khīra (milk-porridge) to offer
to the tree-deity. She sent her maid to the tree to clean the place. When the
maid saw the attractive personality and radiant face of ascetic prince
Siddhattha meditating under the tree, she felt that the tree-deity had taken
this physical form to receive her mistress’s offerings.

<br /> <br /> She rushed home to give this good news to her mistress. Sujata was
joyously surprised. She came to the tree with her khīra in a golden vessel to
offer to the tree-deity. However, she immediately realized that it was not the
tree-deity but a recluse. She offered him the khīra and was delighted when he
accepted it. <br /> <br />
Not knowing this truth completely, some people started adding their own stories.
This is why it was believed by some that Sujata prayed to the tree-deity for an ideal
husband and a son. Due to such fabricated stories, she was portrayed as a young and
a single girl. The truth is that she was a middle-aged woman at that time. She was
married in a rich family and she had a youthful son who was also married. Since Sujata
was certain that her wishes were granted because of the tree-deity she came home
every year to make offerings to the tree-deity. This year, she had come to pray that
like other young men, her son would develop an attraction to worldly things.
<br /> <br />
But on seeing this meditating youth, maternal affection arose in her. Instead of
asking for anything, she offered him the khīra and showered her blessings on him
with the words, ‘May your meditation be fruitful.’ This was the Siddhattha’s last
meal as the Bodhisatta. He attained enlightenment the next night and hence, this
offering of food is considered to be of great importance. <br />
<br />
![Sujata’s Porridge](/0026.jpg) #### Five Dreams

<Divider />

It was the pre-dawn time of the night before the Vesāka full moon
night. The Bodhisatta Siddhattha Gotama lay down under the banyan
tree to rest after meditating alone for the entire night. He dozed
off. While asleep he had five agreeable dreams that bore testimony
to his fruitful future.

<br />
<br />

##### First Dream

![first dream](/0021.JPG)

He saw that his body lay on the ground and progressively grew in
size until it covered Nepal and India. The Himalayas in the
north had become his pillow. His left hand was on the shore of
the Bay of Bengal and the waves of the ocean were washing his
hands. In the south his legs were at the shore of the Indian
Ocean and the waves were washing his legs.

<br />
<br />
This was the first representation of Nepal and India’s geographical boundaries
which indicated that this great man would become a Buddha and his teachings
would be accepted by the entire population of Jambudīpa (roughly today’s India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal). His teaching would spread in the north to the
countries beyond the Himalayas and in the east, west and south via the ocean
route to all of mankind. <br />
<br />
Mount Everest, the highest peak of the Himalayas in Nepal came to be called
Māthā Kuṅwar, which originally meant the place where the Bodhisatta Prince
Siddhattha had rested his head.

###### Geography of India

The region of India and Nepal resembles a rose apple (jāmun).
Therefore, since time immemorial, this region was known as
‘Jambudīpa’. Later, (in the Āμānāμīya sutta) the Buddha
describes south Indian boundaries further. He said that in the
east and west, there are deep oceans which are filled with the
water from the regional rivers.

<br />
<br />
This description is only of the eastern and the western part of southern India.
In the southernmost part, is the island Sri Lanka and no river water flows into
it. This gives us a glimpse of Indian geography. No such description is
available in literature prior to this.

---

##### Second Dream

![second dream](/0022_0.JPG)
A plant germinated from his navel and kept growing higher and
higher into the sky. This was a portent that he would teach not
only human beings but also devas and brahmas. He would be
teacher of humans and gods (satthādevamanussānaṃ). He would be a
teacher of all beings and his teaching would be conducive to the
welfare and happiness of all beings.

---

##### Third Dream

![Third Dream](/0023.JPG)
Countless black-haired beings clothed in white saluted and
worshiped him, indicating that innumerable householders would
become his disciples. Those who had been entangled in various
rites, rituals, and blind faith, would learn the Dhamma from him
and gain infinite benefit.

---

##### Fourth Dream

![Forth Dream](/0024.JPG)
Blue, golden, red and grey birds coming from four directions sat
on his lap and turned white. This indicated that people of all
four classes (brāhmaṇa, khattiya—warrior class, vessa—business
people and sudda—lower castes) would become his disciples,
become monks and nuns and get liberated from the cycle of life
and death. People from all classes and creeds would become his
disciples, would become pure. They would become Dhammika. They
would be liberated from the bondage of sectarian discrimination
and casteism. They would give importance to conduct instead of
religious affiliation and caste.

---

##### Fifth Dream

![Fifth Dream](/0025.JPG)
He saw that he was walking on earth covered with excreta but it
did not touch him. This indicated that even though he resided in
world filled with impurity, he would remain pure. This world
will always be filled with impurity. It is impossible to get rid
of the dirt of the entire world but the Buddha would keep
himself detached from worldly impurity and would always remain
pure.

#### The Attainment of Buddhahood

<Divider />

It was on the eve of the full-moon day of Vesakha[^2], that Prince
Siddhattha, a wandering ascetic, sat cross-legged beneath a Bodhi
tree on the bank of the river Nerañjara in the Forest of Uruvela
(near present day Buddha-gaya)—with the strongest of
determinations—not to rise from that posture on any account until
he gained the Truth and Enlightenment, Buddha-hood—even if the
attempt might mean the loss of his very life.

<br />
<br />
The great event was approaching. The prince ascetic mustered up all his strength
of mind to secure that one-pointedness of mind which is so essential for the
discovery of Truth. The balancing of the mind, the prince found on this
occasion, was not so easy as hitherto. There was not only the combination of the
mental forces of the lower planes with those of the higher planes all around
him, but also interferences strong enough to upset, off and on, the equilibrium
of his mind. The resistance of the impenetrable masses of forces against the
radiation of the light normally secured by him was unusual, perhaps because it
was a final bid for Buddha-hood, and Mara, the supreme controller of evil
forces, was behind the scene.
<br />
<br />
The prince, however, worked his way through slowly but surely, backed up by the mental
forces of virtues which must inevitably come back to him at the right moment. He
made a vow and called upon all the brahmas and devas who had witnessed the fulfillment
of his ten great perfections to join hands with him in the struggle for supremacy.
This done, the association with the transcending pure mental forces of the brahmas
and devas had a salutary effect. The thick masses of forces, which seemed impenetrable
for a time, broke away, and with steady improvement in the control over the mind,
they were wiped out once and for all.
<br />
<br />
All the hindrances having been overcome, the prince was able to raise his power
of concentration and put the mind in a state of complete purity, tranquility and
equanimity. Gradually, the consciousness of true insight possessed him. The
solution to the vital problems which confronted him made its appearance in his
consciousness as an inspiration. By introspective meditation on the realities of
nature in his own self, it came vividly to him that there is no substantiality,
as there seems to be, in the human body and that it is nothing but the sum total
of innumerable millions of kalapas, each about the size of 1/46,656th part of a
particle of dust raised by the wheel of a chariot in summer. On further
investigation, he realized that this kalapa also is matter in constant change or
flux. So also with the mind, which is a representation of the mental forces
(creative) going out and the mental forces (created) coming into the system of
an individual continually and throughout eternity.
<br />
<br />
The Buddha then proclaimed that the Eye of Wisdom (panna-cakkhu) arose when he overcame
all false perception of substantiality within his own self. He saw by means of the
lens of samadhi (concentration) the kalapas on which he next applied the law of anicca
(impermanence) and reduced them to nonentity or behavior, doing away with what we,
according to the Buddha's teaching, call paññatti (concept) and coming to a state
of paramattha, understanding the nature of forces or, in other words, Ultimate Reality.
<br />
<br />
Accordingly, he came to a realization of the perpetual change of mind and matter
in himself (anicca) and as a sequel thereto the Truth of Suffering (dukkha). It
was then that the ego-centralism in him broke down into the void, and he got
over to a stage beyond suffering (dukkha-nirodha) with no more traces of atta,
or attachment to self, left behind. Mind and-matter were to him but empty
phenomena which roll on forever, within the range of the Law of Cause and Effect
and the Law of Dependent Origination. The Truth was realized. The inherent
qualities of an Embryo Buddha then developed, and complete Enlightenment came to
him by the dawn of Vesakha. Verily, Prince Siddhattha attained Samma-sambodhi
(Supreme Enlightenment) and became the Buddha, the Awakened One, the Enlightened
One, the All-Knowing One. He was awake in a way compared with which all others
were asleep and dreaming. He was enlightened in a way compared with which all
other men were stumbling and groping in the dark. He knew with a knowledge
compared with which all that other men knew was but a kind of ignorance.
<br />
<br />

With the experience of total liberation the following words of joy (udana) came forth: <br />

<br />

**_“Anekajatisamsaram sandhavissam anibbisam, gahakarakam
gavesanto dukkha jati punappunam. Gahakaraka dittho’si puna
geham na kahasi,sabba te phasuka bhagga gahakutam
visankhitam,visankharagatam cittam tanhanam khayamajjhaga”._**<br /> <br />

**_-Through countless births I wandered in samsara, seeking, but
not finding, the builder of the house. I have been taking
birth in misery again and again. O builder of the house you
are now seen! You cannot build the house again. All the
rafters and the central pole are shattered. The mind is free
from all the sankhara. The craving-free stage is achieved._**<br />

<br />

After his enlightenment the Buddha spent several weeks enjoying nibbanic peace.
At the end of this period Tapassu and Bhallika, two merchants of Ukkala offered
him rice cakes and honey. These two became the first lay disciples (upasaka)
taking refuge only in the Buddha and the Dhamma, as the Sangha had not yet come
into being.

<br />
<br />

The Burmese tradition maintains that both these merchants were from Okkala, an ancient
city near present day Rangoon. The Burmese take pride in the fact that the first
people to give respect to the Buddha and the Dhamma were from Burma, and that the
first food that the Buddha took after enlightenment was Burmese rice and honey. <br />

<br />

#### Spread of Dhamma

<Divider />

With infinite compassion the Buddha decided to teach the profound
Dhamma. His two previous teachers Alara Kalama and Uddaka
Ramaputta, who could both have understood the Dhamma, had passed
away. So he decided to go to the Isipatana-migadaya at Saranath,
the deer park near Varanasi, to teach his five companions who had
left him just before his enlightenment. It was on the full moon
day of Asalha (June-July) that the Buddha set in motion the Wheel
of the Dhamma by teaching the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta
explaining the middle path to them. They became his first five
bhikkhu disciples and therefore the first members of the Bhikkhu
Sangha (Order of Monks). This sermon was later followed by the
Anatta-lakkhana Sutta at the end of which all five became fully
liberated (arahant) by the practice of Vipassana. They realised
the truth of the impermanent, substance less, and unsatisfactory
nature of reality (anicca, dukkha, and anatta) at the experiential
level.

<br />
<br />
Not long after this, Yasa, the depressed and mentally disturbed son of a wealthy
merchant of Varanasi who could not find peace in his riches and way of life,
approached the Buddha and received ordination. He was followed by his fifty-four
friends who also became monks. Having tasted Dhamma, they soon gained the peace
which they sought and with continued practice they all attained the stage of
arahant. Yasa’s father and mother became the first lay disciples to take refuge
in the Triple Gem, since now there were three qualities in which to take refuge:
the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.
<br />
<br />
The next months were the rainy season and the Buddha spent them in retreat (vassavasa)
at Saranath with the Sangha, which had grown to sixty arahant bhikkhus. As the rainy
season ended he instructed them as follows: <br />
<br />{" "}

**_“Wander forth, O monks, for the benefit of many, for the
happiness of many. Shower compassion on the world for the
good, benefit, and happiness of gods and men. Let no two go in
the same direction.”_**

    <br />
    <br />

The Buddha sent these sixty bhikkhus to various places to teach the Dhamma.
Because they had realised the truth of the path to liberation themselves,
they became shining examples of what they taught. Their teaching did not
consist of mere discourses, mere words. Their success lay in enabling the
people to practice what was taught. The nature of the Dhamma is that it is
beneficial in the beginning, beneficial in the middle, and beneficial in the
end. The results of the practice (patipatti) started to manifest. People
from different sects, castes, and classes were attracted. Leaders of various
sects started practicing the Dhamma. While the Buddha was on his way to
Senanigama at Uruvela, the thirty Bhaddavaggiya received ordination. At
Uruvela, the three Kassapa brothers with their thousand followers became
monks. Also the two Brahmans Sariputta and Moggallana took ordination, and
later became the chief disciples of the Buddha.

<br /> <br />

Many other important people of that time also became attracted to pure
Dhamma: the Kings Bimbisara, Suddhodana, and Prasenajita; the wealthy
merchants Anathapindika, Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka, and Kakavaliya;
and important women such as Visakha, Suppavasa, and Khema. They donated
various monasteries to the Sangha with the wholesome volition that the
Dhamma might spread throughout society. These facilities enabled people to
learn and practice the Dhamma, and thereby come out of their suffering.

<br /> <br />
The Buddha spent his second, third, and fourth rainy seasons at Rajagaha in the Bamboo
Grove donated by King Bimbisara. The Buddha always remained at one place for the
rains and moved around northern India teaching Dhamma during the rest of the year.
One of these journeys was to Kapilavatthu at the invitation of King Suddhodana. The
Buddha was received with honors by the native Sakyans. During this visit thousands
of them joined the Sangha, including his son Rahula and stepbrother Nanda. Others
such as Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta, and even the royal
barber Upali, also joined.
<br /> <br />

The fifth rainy season was spent in Vesali. It was in that year that King Suddhodana,
the Buddha’s father, died. His widow, Mahapajapati Gotami, requested the Buddha to
allow women to join the Sangha. Ananda interceded on their behalf and their request
was granted. This was the beginning of the Order of Nuns (Bhikkhuni Sangha).

<br /> <br />

The Buddha spent the next rains retreat at Mankulapabbata, and the seventh at Tavatimsa
preaching Abhidhamma (higher teachings) to Mahamaya and other devas.

<br /> <br />

Subsequently, the eighth to the nineteenth rains retreats were spent at the following
places: Bhesakalavana, Kosambi, Parileyyaka Forest, the Brahman village of Ekanala,
Veranja, Calikapabbata, Jetavana in Savatthi, Kapilavatthu, Alavi, and Rajagaha.

<br />
<br />

In the twentieth year the Buddha transformed the life of the ferocious
Angulimala who had earlier killed 999 people. Coming into contact with the
Dhamma, Angulimala became a saintly person and later on became an arahant. The
Buddha spent the twentieth retreat at Rajagaha.

<br /> <br />

From the twenty-first up to the forty-sixth, his final rains retreat, the Buddha
spent his time at Savatthi in the Jetavana Vihara and Pubbarama Vihara.

<br /> <br />

Throughout his life he continually faced opposition from those espousing old
superstitions and beliefs based on birth, caste, class, animal sacrifice, etc.
At times he faced great opposition from sectarians who tried to discredit him
and his teaching by trying to create scandals. One monk, Devadatta, tried to
create a schism in the Sangha, and even tried to kill the Buddha by various
means. In all instances the Buddha used his infinite wisdom, love, and
compassion to overcome these opposing forces, and continued to serve more and
more suffering beings.

#### Mahaparinibbana of Budhha

<Divider />

At the age of eighty the Buddha visited Vesali courtesan Ambapali offered him a meal and made a gift of her Ambalatthika
Grove to the Sangha. Through the practice of Dhamma she came out
of immorality, established herself in truth, and became an
arahant. Later in the same year he visited Pava and stayed in the
mango grove of Cunda. Here he took what was to be his last meal,
and became ill. In this weakened condition he continued on to
Kusinara. There he instructed Ananda to spread his upper robe
between twin sala trees, and informed him that the end of his life
had come. A large number of monks, lay followers, and devas
assembled around him to pay their last respects. The Buddha gave
them his last admonition, known as pacchima-vaca:

<br /> <br />
![Maha parinibbana of Buddha](/0108.JPG) **_“Vaya-dhamma sankhara,appamadena sampadetha”.
<br />
<br />
-Decay is inherent in all compounded things,
<br /> work out your own salvation with diligence._**

              <br /> <br />

Thus teaching the Dhamma as he himself practiced it, the Buddha
attained Mahaparinibbana in his eightieth year, on the full moon
day of Vesakha in 544 B.C
