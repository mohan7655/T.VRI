*We serve merely for the sake of serving, without expecting anything in return. And the result will be to create an atmosphere of love, good-will and purity, which will help those who come now, and in later generations, to grasp the Dhamma and find real peace.
Therefore, Dhamma service is an extraordinary opportunity. Perform it to liberate yourselves and to help others be liberated from defilements, from bondages, from misery. Be the torchbearers of the Dhamma to dispel the surrounding darkness of ignorance and suffering* <br/>
***- S. N. Goenka***<br/><br/>

Giving Dhamma Seva, whether in a course or in some other way to help in the spread of Dhamma, is one of the most valuable experiences a student of Vipassana can have. Not only is it rewarding to know that you have helped others to taste the Nectar of Dhamma, but it also is a wonderful source of growth and strength in one's own development in meditation practice.<br/><br/>

#### Different Ways of Serving
<Divider/>

There are numerous ways to serve. Due to busy schedules and hectic lifestyles, serving a full 10-day course may not be possible for many students as often as they would like. However, students can gain merits by serving on holidays, weekends or in their spare time. There are many opportunities/programmes available for serving, ranging from few hours to months, where students can participate as per their convenience. The essence of these programmes/opportunities is to stay connected with the Center and in turn, getting established in the practice.
