*Those who serve must bear in mind that they exemplify to newcomers the efficacy of the Dhamma. If they are devoid of good qualities, they will discourage others from practicing the Dhamma. They have a great responsibility to see that their behaviour inspires confidence in Dhamma in those who were doubtful, and greater faith where it already exists.* 
***- S. N. Goenka***

There is no better training ground than serving the entire length of the course. It is indeed an ideal way to learn how to apply dhamma in daily life. Besides, it gives dhamma servers immense joy to see students coming out of their misery. 
Serving 10-Day Courses

Serving a 10-day course is a very special kind of service. It is an invaluable tool for strengthening our own practice as well as helping others to get Dhamma. If you wish to serve any 10-day course, please contact the respective Center.
Nature of activities involved in 10-day course service:

Activities involved in a 10-day course are segregated as Dhamma hall, dining hall, compounding and belling.

On arrival at the center, the course manager or the conducting teacher will allocate responsibility to each server after meeting them in person. During the course, Dhamma servers can meet the conducting teacher, in case they need some clarification or change in their time-table.

Guidelines for 10-Day Dhamma Servers

Guidelines for Dhamma servers may vary from Center to Center. The following are essential guidelines:

Five Precepts - All Dhamma servers must observe the five precepts for the entire duration of their seva.

Daily Meditation Practice – All residential servers must meditate for at least 3 hours a day, and are also required to attend evening Metta. 

Segregation of the Sexes - To protect the Dhamma atmosphere of the Center, segregation of the sexes should be maintained at all times, both during and between courses. There are separate accommodations for men and women, and separate dining areas as well. Dhamma servers must be very careful to treat those of the opposite sex as their Dhamma brothers or sisters.

Reading Material - If available, Dhamma servers may use the centre Library of Dhamma books. Reading other material is not appropriate at the centre.

Telephone and Email – Just like students, servers of 10-day courses, should deposit their mobile with administration on day 0. They are also not allowed to use centre telephone, except with the permission of the conducting teacher.

Use of Center Property - As a Dhamma server, one lives the life of renunciation. The center will provide the basic requirements of food and shelter; other expenses are the responsibility of the servers themselves. As everything at the centre is the result of Dana by other students, Dhamma servers should take care that they are not using property of the centre for their own use without permission.
