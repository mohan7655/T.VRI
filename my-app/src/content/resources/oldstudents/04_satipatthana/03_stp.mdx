The third day of the Satipaṭṭhāna course is over.<br/><br/>

We expressed our gratitude to the old monk because of whom Mahākassapa decided to compile all the teachings. As a result, they were maintained in their pristine purity from generation to generation. Sometimes something very wholesome results from an unwholesome situation. This is what happened. Over the centuries six councils of monks have recited and authenticated the Tipiṭaka, to remove any mistakes that had crept in. Three councils were held in India, one in Sri Lanka, and two in Myanmar. The sixth and most recent was in Rangoon in 1955-56, 2,500 years after the Buddha passed away. Just as we are grateful to those who maintained the practice in its pristine purity, we are also grateful to those who have maintained the purity of the Buddha’s words. Today we can compare the words with the technique, and derive more inspiration by knowing that we are practising as the Buddha taught.<br/><br/>

We continue with the discourse.<br/><br/>

##### The Four Satipaṭṭhānas

As we discussed, there are four satipaṭṭhānas:<br/>

- kāye kāyānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ;

- vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ;

- citte cittānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ;

- dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ.<br/><br/>

The purpose of satipaṭṭhāna is to explore the area which is identified with "I," to which so much attachment develops. There are two distinct fields: kāya (body) and citta (mind).<br/><br/>

The exploration must be done at the experiential, not the intellectual, level. If you try to understand body just by taking the attention, say, to the head and asserting that "This is my head," it is only an intellectual truth, that of saññā (recognition). To experience reality you must feel it. Therefore there must be sensation, and kāya (body) and vedanā (sensation) go together in this exploration.<br/><br/>

Similarly with citta: to sit down and merely assert that this is your mind will only be an imagination or at best an intellectual understanding. To experience mind, something must arise in the mind: perhaps some strong craving or aversion, or some thought. It arises and passes away. Whatever it is is called dhamma, the literal meaning of which is dhāretī ti dhamma, "that which is contained" by citta. Just as kāya and vedanā go together, citta and dhamma go together. Then, as the Buddha elsewhere announced from his own experience, another reality:vedanā-samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā. "Everything that arises in the mind starts flowing with a sensation on the body." Samosaraṇā means "gets collected together and flows."<br/><br/>

Vedanā therefore becomes so important. To explore the kāya you have to feel sensations. Similarly in the exploration of citta and dhamma, everything that arises in the mind manifests as a sensation.<br/><br/>

**Continuing, each satipaṭṭhāna has certain similar words**:<br/><br/>

**Kāye kāyānupassī viharati**: anupassī comes from passana or dassana, "to look." You see things directly yourself. Vipassanā means seeing in a special way, the correct way. Vividhena means in different ways, from different angles. Vicayena means by dividing, dissecting, disintegrating. So you observe whatever reality has arisen. Anupassanā means continuously from moment to moment. Thus kāye kāyānupassī is to observe the body from moment to moment within, that is, in the body. Similarly vedanāsu is in the sensations, citte is in the mind and dhammesu is in the mental contents.<br/><br/>

Vipassana uses no imagination. You could imagine a sensation and that it is changing even without experiencing it, but this is not reality as it is, where it is. Your body must be experienced in your own body, sensations in your own sensations, mind in your own mind, mental contents in your own mental contents. Therefore the meditator lives, dwells observing body in the body, ātāpī sampajāno satimā.<br/><br/>

**Ātāpī** literally means tapas, "burning." A meditator who is working very ardently, very diligently, burns off the mental impurities. Satimā means "aware." Sampajāno means having the quality of sampajañña. The awareness must be with sampajañña, the paññā that feels the arising and passing away of vedanā, because impermanence has to be experienced at the level of vedanā. Thus the observation, whether of kāya, vedanā, citta, or dhammā must be ātāpī sampajāno satimā.<br/><br/>

**Vineyya loke abhijjhā-domanassaṃ…** Keeping away from craving and aversion towards this world of mind and matter.<br/><br/>

Vineyya means to keep away from, or to abstain from. Lokas are the planes of the universe. Here loke means the entire field of mind and matter, all five aggregates which constitute "I": the material aggregate (rūpa) and the four mental aggregates of cognising (viññāṇa) recognising (saññā) feeling (vedanā) and reacting (saṅkhāra). All four satipaṭṭhānas can be practised only with the base of vedanā. This is because unless something is felt (vedanā), craving and aversion (abhijjhā-domanassaṃ) cannot arise. If the sensation is pleasant, only then does craving arise; if the sensation is unpleasant, only then does aversion arise. If you don’t experience sensations, you won’t even know that craving or aversion has arisen, and you can’t come out of them.<br/><br/>

##### Ānāpānapabbaṃ

**_—Observation of Respiration_**<br/><br/>

In exploring the field of matter, the body (kāya), the first chapter is on Ānāpāna, the respiration coming in and going out.<br/><br/>

**_Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu araññagato vā rukkhamūlagato vā suññāgāragato vā_**<br/><br/>

A place of solitude is required—secluded and with no disturbance. The meditator goes to a forest (arañña-gato vā) the foot of a tree (rukkha-mūla-gato vā) or a place where nobody lives (suññāgāra-gato vā), like the individual cells you have here—any of these three.<br/><br/>

**_nisīdati pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā, ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya_**<br/><br/>

The meditator must sit down (nisīdati). Pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā means "cross-legged." The lotus or half-lotus posture is not necessary. If this is possible, it is a posture that brings greater alertness, but otherwise any cross-legged posture that is comfortable for longer periods at a stretch is good enough. The upper portion of the body should be straight:<br/><br/>

**ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya. <br/>
parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā**<br/><br/>

The awareness is established around the mouth, the entrance to the nostrils: parimukhaṃ. Certain traditions translate this as "in the front," as if the awareness is imagined to be in front of the person, but this sets up a duality. Actually you have to feel the breath coming and going around the mouth, above the upper lip, which is parimukhaṃ.<br/><br/>

**Then the work starts:**

**_So sato va assasati, sato va passasati._**<br/><br/>

With awareness he breathes in, with awareness he breathes out.<br/><br/>

**_Dīghaṃ vā assasanto ‘Dīghaṃ assasāmīti’ pajānāti, dīghaṃ vā passasanto ‘Dīghaṃ passasāmīti’ pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

Breathing in a deep breath (dīgha), he understands properly (pajānāti): "I am breathing in a deep breath." Breathing out a deep breath, he understands properly: "I am breathing out a deep breath." The long in-breath, and similarly the long out-breath, is known and understood as such: because it is felt, experienced.<br/><br/>

**_Rassaṃ vā assasanto ‘Rassaṃ assasāmīti’ pajānāti, rassaṃ vā passasanto ‘Rassaṃ passasāmīti’ pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

Now the breath becomes shallow, short (rassa), and is understood in the same way. You will see how each sentence signifies another station on the path, a new experience. As the mind calms down the agitation decreases, and the breath becomes short. It is not controlled as in a breathing exercise, but just observed.<br/><br/>

**_‘Sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati; ‘sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati_**.<br/><br/>

Now he trains himself: "Feeling the whole body (sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī), I shall breathe in, feeling the whole body, I shall breathe out." Instead of pajānāti, to understand properly, the word sikkhati, "learns, trains" is now used. As meditators, after a day or two’s work with the breath, you have experienced sensation in this area. Then working with both you reach the stage of feeling sensation throughout the body—sabba-kāya. Initially it is very gross, solidified, intensified, but as you keep practising patiently, persistently, remaining equanimous with every experience, the whole body dissolves into subtle vibrations, and you reach the stage of bhaṅga, total dissolution. Having started with natural breath, you learn to reach the important station of feeling sensations in the whole body in one breath: from top to bottom as you breathe out, from bottom to top as you breathe in.<br/><br/>

Without practice there will be confusion. Other traditions interpret these words as "the body of the breath," as if the beginning, middle, end, and so the whole breath is felt. Of course, as oxygen enters the bloodstream with the breath, it moves throughout the body from the top of the head to the toes, and sensation flows with the blood. It could be taken in this sense, but we are practising kāyānupassanā. The whole body must be felt, and this is what a meditator experiences.<br/><br/>

When bhaṅga comes, following all the unpleasant sensations, the tendency of the mind is to react with craving and clinging. This is a dangerous (ādīnava), fearful (bhaya) situation. It is much easier to stop having aversion to unpleasant sensation than to stop having craving towards pleasant sensation. Yet this craving is the mother of aversion, and Vipassana is to work vineyya loke abhijjhā-domanassaṃ—without craving or aversion. You have to keep understanding that the pleasant sensation also is anicca, nothing but tiny wavelets, bubbles, arising and passing. With this paññā the impurities get eradicated and the station of calmness, tranquillity is reached.<br/><br/>

**_‘Passambhayaṃ kāyasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘passambhayaṃ kāyasaṅkhāraṃ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati._**

Now with the body activities (kāyasaṅkhāra) calmed (passambhayaṃ) he trains himself to breathe in and out. Again the word sikkhati is used, because this station is reached by learning, by practice. The one-hour adhiṭṭhāna sitting in which the posture is not changed, which was initially a struggle, becomes natural. There is no movement of the body because there is no unpleasant sensation anywhere. Breath becomes the only movement. This also is a kāya-saṅkhāra, a movement or activity of the body. As the mind is trained to become calm and tranquil, the breath also becomes shorter, calmer, subtler until it just makes a U-turn as it enters, and at times it seems to stop. It is so fine. Here also there is the danger of attachment, of taking this as the final stage.<br/><br/>

Now the Buddha gives the example of a carpenter, who, then as now, turns and cuts wood, for instance to make a leg for a piece of furniture. He uses a lathe. A long turn of the lathe makes a thicker cut than a short turn. He, or his apprentice, knows well (pajānāti) whether his turn is long or short; similarly the meditator knows well (pajānāti) whether the breath is long or short.<br/><br/>

In the example the lathe cuts at the point of contact. Similarly the attention is to be kept where the breath touches. You should not follow the breath deep inside or outside into the atmosphere. You are aware of this area and you also feel the whole breath coming in or going out.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati, bahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati, ajjhattabahiddhā vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati_**.<br/><br/>

In the next important station, with the help of the breath the whole body is felt inside, or within oneself, ajjhattaṃ. Then it is also felt outside, bahiddhā, on the surface of the body, and lastly simultaneously both inside and outside.<br/><br/>

These are the Buddha’s words. Certain commentaries or subcommentaries have been written on them, some 1,000 to 1,500 years after the Buddha, and some even more recently. They give many good explanations of the Buddha’s words, and also descriptions of a whole spectrum of life and society at that time—political, social, educational, and economic aspects. However they give certain interpretations which this tradition of meditation cannot accept. For instance, here a commentary takes ajjhattaṃ as the meditator’s body—which is acceptable—but bahiddhā as the body of someone else, even though no one else is there. It explains that the meditator can simply think of someone else, and how all beings similarly breathe in and out. We cannot agree with this because this is imagination, and in this tradition vipassanā or anupassanā is to observe within your own body (kāye). Therefore for us bahiddhā is the surface of the body, but still within its framework.<br/><br/>

Ajjhatta-bahiddhā can also be understood in relation to the five sense doors. When an outside object comes into contact with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, or body surface, it is felt within the framework of the body, but on the surface of the body. Even the mind is within the framework of the body, although its object may be outside. The Sutta still does not intend you to start thinking of or seeing another body.<br/><br/>

The next few sentences appear in every chapter. They describe the real practice of Vipassana, and great care should be taken to understand them properly.<br/><br/>

**_Samudayadhammānupassī vā kāyasmiṃ viharati, vayadhammānupassī vā kāyasmiṃ viharati, samudayavayadhammānupassī vā kāyasmiṃ viharati…_**<br/><br/>

Samudaya-dhammānupassī: the dhamma, the reality, or the truth of arising (samudaya) is observed within the body. Then the truth of passing away (vaya) is observed. The gross sensation arises, seems to stay for some time, then passes away. Arising and passing are seen as separate. Then in the stage of bhaṅga, total dissolution, the sensation is one of vibrations that arise and pass with great rapidity. Samudaya and vaya are experienced together: there is no interval. According to the Visuddhimagga, the Path of Purification, the first important station is called udayabbaya. A meditator must understand this and the next stage of bhaṅga well.<br/><br/>

**_…‘atthi kāyo’ti vā panassa sati paccupaṭṭhitā hoti._**<br/><br/>

Now his awareness is established: "This is body" (‘atthi kāyo’ ti). This is the stage in which the body is experienced as "not I," "not mine," but just body, just a mass of vibrations, bubbles, wavelets. It is merely a collection of kalāpas, subatomic particles, arising and passing. There is nothing good or bad, beautiful or ugly, white or brown about it. Initially the acceptance of anattā, "not I," is intellectual or devotional, based on the words of someone else. The actual experience starts with anicca, because every pleasant sensation turns into an unpleasant one. The danger of attachment is realised. It is dukkha because of its inherent nature of change. Then anattā is understood: the body is felt as just subatomic particles arising and passing, and automatically the attachment to body goes away. It is a high stage when the awareness, sati, gets established, paccupaṭṭhitā hoti, in this truth from moment to moment.<br/><br/>

**Proceeding further:**<br/><br/>

**_Yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya…_**<br/><br/>

Matta means "mere." There is mere wisdom, mere knowledge, mere observation. This is to the extent (yāvadeva) that there is no wise person, no-one to know or experience. In another Indian tradition it is called kevala-ñāṇa kevala-dassana, "only knowing, only seeing."<br/><br/>

In the Buddha’s time a very old hermit lived at a place called Supārapattaṃ, near present-day Bombay. Having practised the eight jhānas, deep mental absorptions, he thought himself fully enlightened. A well-wisher corrected him, telling him that a Buddha was now present at Sāvatthi, who could teach him the real practice for becoming enlightened. He was so excited to hear this he went all the way to Sāvatthi in northern India. Reaching the monastery, he found that the Buddha had gone out for alms, so he went directly to the city. He found the Buddha walking down a street and immediately understood that this was the Buddha. He asked him then and there for the technique to become an arahant. The Buddha told him to wait for an hour or so, to be taught in the monastery, but he insisted: he might die within the hour, or the Buddha might die, or he might lose his present great faith in the Buddha. Now was the time when all these three were present. The Buddha looked and realised that very soon this man would die, and indeed should be given Dhamma now. So he spoke just a few words to this developed old hermit, there on the side of the road: Diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṃ bhavissati… "In seeing there is mere seeing, in hearing mere hearing, in smelling mere smelling, in tasting mere tasting, in touching mere touching, and in cognising only cognising"…viññāte viññātamattaṃ bhavissati.<br/><br/>

This was sufficient. At the stage of mere knowing, what is being cognised or the identity of who cognises is irrelevant. There is mere understanding. The dip in nibbāna follows, where there is nothing to hold, no base to stand on (anissito).<br/><br/>

**_…anissito ca viharati, na ca kiñci loke upādiyati_**<br/><br/>

The entire field of mind and matter (loka) is transcended, and there is no world or universe to grasp (upādiyati).<br/><br/>

Whether it is for a few minutes or few hours depends on the capacity and previous work of the person. A person in nibbāna is as if dead: none of the senses function, although inside the person is very aware, very alert, very awakened. After that the person returns and again starts functioning in the sensory field, but a fully liberated person has no attachment, no clinging, because there is no craving. Such a person will cling to nothing in the entire universe and nothing clings to them. This is the stage described.<br/><br/>

So a meditator practises. Those who practise these sentences will understand the meaning of every word given, but mere intellectualisation won’t help. Real understanding comes with experience.<br/><br/>

---

##### Iriyāpathapabbaṃ

**—Postures of the Body**<br/><br/>

Iriyāpatha are postures of the body.<br/><br/>

**_gacchanto vā ‘gacchāmī’ti pajānāti, ṭhito vā ‘ṭhitomhī’ ti pajānāti, nisinno vā ‘nisinnomhī’ti pajānāti, sayāno vā ‘sayānomhī’ti pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

When walking (gacchanto), a meditator knows well ‘I am walking’ (‘gacchāmi’). Similarly, whether standing (ṭhito), sitting (nisinno), or lying down (sayāno) a meditator knows this well. This is just the beginning. In the sentence that follows, not "I", but just "body" is known well in whatever posture (yathā yathā paṇihito).<br/><br/>

**Yathā yathā vā panassa kāyo paṇihito hoti, tathā tathā naṃ pajānāti.**<br/><br/>

Then, in a repetition of the same sentences, the body is observed inside, outside, and both inside and outside simultaneously. Arising is observed, then passing, then both together. Actually it is the sensations that are observed as arising and passing away, because sampajāñña, the understanding of anicca, has to be present, as in every chapter. Awareness follows that ‘This is body,’ and that it is not "I." This is established with wisdom. Then mere understanding and awareness follow, without any base to hold. There is nothing to grasp.<br/><br/>

**Iti ajjhattaṃ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati… ‘atthi kayo’ ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati.**<br/><br/>

---

##### Sampajānapabbaṃ

**_—Constant Thorough Understanding of Impermanence_**<br/><br/>

**_…Abhikkante paṭikkante sampajāna-kārī hoti. Ālokite vilokite…samiñjite pasārite…saṅghāṭi-patta-cīvara-dhāraṇe…asite pīte khāyite sāyite…uccāra-passāva-kamme…gate ṭhite nisinne sutte jāgarite bhāsite tuṇhī-bhāve sampajāna-kārī hoti_**.<br/><br/>

**"Walking forward or coming back, looking straight or sideways, bending or stretching, with robes or begging bowl, eating, drinking, chewing, attending to the calls of nature, walking, standing, sitting, lying down, awake or asleep, speaking or remaining silent"—whatever the activity sampajañña is being practised (sampajāna-kārī hoti)**.<br/><br/>

The same stages are then repeated:<br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati… ‘atthi kayo’ ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati._**<br/><br/>

We have already seen that sampajañña has to be present everywhere, every moment. The Buddha was frequently asked about sati. Every time his reply included sampajañña:<br/><br/>

**_kāye kāyānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā<br/>
vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā<br/>
citte cittānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā<br/>
dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā_**.<br/><br/>

Without sampajañña, sati is only the awareness of the circus girl. If there is no awareness of arising and passing, it will not lead to liberation.<br/><br/>

When asked about sampajañña itself, the Buddha used to reply with either of two explanations.<br/><br/>

One explanation was the observation with paññā of the arising, staying and passing away of three things: vedanā (sensation), saññā (perception) and vitakka (the sense object)—for instance a sound at the ear sense door. These objects are also called dhammā, and they flow with sensations—vedanā-samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā. Again, the arising and passing of sensation is predominant in sampajañña.<br/><br/>

The paragraph in this Sutta was another explanation: sampajañña embraces every activity. The meaning is that continuity is required.<br/><br/>

To illustrate the point, in another discourse the Buddha said:<br/>

**_Yato ca bhikkhu ātāpī, sampajaññaṃ na riñcati; <br/>
tato so vedanā sabbā parijānāti paṇḍito.<br/>
So vedanā pariññāya diṭṭhe dhamme anāsavo, <br/>
kāyassa bhedā Dhammaṭṭho, saṅkhyaṃ nopeti vedagū._**<br/><br/>

**When a meditator practising ardently, <br/>
does not miss sampajañña even for a moment, <br/>
such a wise one fully understands all sensations.<br/>
And having completely understood them, he becomes freed from all impurities.**<br/><br/>

On the breaking up of the body, such a person, being established in Dhamma and understanding sensations perfectly, attains the indescribable stage beyond the conditioned world.<br/><br/>

The arahant, having understood the entire field of sensations, from the grossest to the subtlest, does not after death return to this field of arising and passing away. Sampajañña is therefore essential in the Buddha’s teaching. If you don’t understand it you may be carried away in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>

Sometimes translations of words create difficulties. Other schools are not to be condemned but we should understand what we are doing. Sometimes sampajañña is mistranslated "clear comprehension." Of what? It is taken to mean of gross details: while walking someone comprehends the lifting, moving, placing of one leg, then the other leg, and so forth. Actually the Buddha wants you to feel vedanā, arising, staying and passing away. If the understanding of vedanā is missed, the whole technique becomes polluted.<br/><br/>

Therefore sampajañña has to be continuous in every situation. Even when sleeping, it should be present. When students begin they are told that they are helpless in deep sleep, and just to be aware in the waking hours, but at a high stage in meditation there is no normal sleep at all. Full rest is taken, but with sampajañña inside, the awareness of sensations arising and passing, of anicca. Sometimes on courses students start to have this experience, reporting that they had little or no sleep, but still felt quite fresh. They were with sampajañña.<br/><br/>

In every chapter the repetition of certain words indicates the importance of this sampajañña. Ātāpī sampajāno satimā applies to the observation of kāya, vedanā, citta and dhammā: sampajañña has to be present. Similarly samudaya-, vaya-, and samudaya-vaya-dhammānupassī, which apply everywhere in the Sutta, have to be with sampajañña and sensations. For example, in Myanmar there are many pagodas on plateaus, with four staircases, one each from the east, west, north and south. Similarly you might start with kāya, vedanā, citta, or dhammā, but as you enter the gallery they all intermingle in vedanā, and reaching the shrine room it is the same nibbāna. Whichever staircase you start climbing, you come to vedanā and sampajañña: and if you are with sampajañña you are progressing step by step towards the final goal.<br/><br/>

Make use of the time. You have to work, no-one else can work for you. Pariyatti will give you proper direction and inspiration, but the benefit will be from your own work. Your practice of paṭipatti and paṭivedhana is to pierce this curtain of ignorance and reach the ultimate truth about mind, matter and the mental contents, to experience nibbāna. Make best use of this opportunity and the facilities. Make use of this wonderful Dhamma for your own good, benefit and liberation from the miseries and bondages of life. May you all enjoy real peace, harmony, and happiness.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy.**
