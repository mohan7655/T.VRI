##### Catusaccapabbaṃ

**_—The Four Noble Truths_**<br/><br/>

**_dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati catūsu ariyasaccesu_**<br/><br/>

How is dhammānupassanā practised observing the Four Noble Truths?<br/><br/>

\*\*\*‘idaṃ dukkhaṃ’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti,<br/>
‘ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti,<br/>
‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodho’ ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti,<br/>
‘ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā’ti yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti.<br/><br/>

---

"This is suffering." "This is the arising of suffering." "This is the total cessation of suffering." "This is the path which leads to the total cessation of suffering." Each truth is understood as it is.<br/><br/>

Pajānāti means to understand in wisdom. Yathābhutaṃ—as it is, as it happens—means direct experience and understanding, as taught in the Buddha’s first discourse. The fact that suffering resulted from craving was already known. That craving had to be eradicated was not new. Everyone is suffering, but that fact by itself does not make anyone a noble person. The Buddha’s discovery was how to make it an ariya sacca, a noble truth, so that whoever experiences it becomes a noble person, attains at least the first experience of nibbāna, the first stage of liberation.<br/><br/>

For each of the Four Noble Truths three things are necessary, making twelve in all. The first part of the First Noble Truth—"This is suffering"—is understood by everybody. The second part, pariññeyya, means however that every aspect of suffering must be understood, the entire field. The same word parijānāti was previously used for the total understanding of vedanā, with sampajañña. Parijānāti comes when vedanā is transcended. If not, some part of the field of vedanā might still be unexplored. Similarly the entire field of dukkha has to be explored, up to its limit. Then the third part comes: pariññāta, "It is totally explored." This means that it is transcended: it is an ariya sacca. The claim to have explored the entire field of dukkha can only be made when it is transcended.<br/><br/>

On the surface there are four Noble Truths, but as you go deeper they culminate in one, like the four satipaṭṭhānas.<br/><br/>

Dukkha samudaya, the arising or cause of suffering—that is, craving—is the Second Noble Truth. Again, intellectual acceptance and surface understanding of this basic principle survive from the teachings of previous Buddhas. However the second part of it is pahātabbaṃ: craving should be totally eradicated. Then comes the third, pahīnaṃ: it is totally eradicated; the stage of final liberation is reached. The Buddha’s contribution was to re-establish this deeper aspect, which had long ago disappeared.<br/><br/>

Similarly mere acceptance of the Third Noble Truth—dukkha nirodha, the cessation of suffering—out of devotion or logic is insufficient. Its second part is sacchikātabbaṃ: it is to be witnessed. Its third stage is sacchikataṃ: it has been witnessed, and so is complete.<br/><br/>

The Fourth Noble Truth of the Path is also meaningless if it is merely accepted intellectually. Its second part is bhāvetabbaṃ: it has to be practised repeatedly until bhāvitaṃ, its full completion. Only when he had walked on the whole Path, only when he had completed all Four Noble Truths, each in these three ways, did Gotama call himself a Buddha.<br/><br/>

Initially the five friends to whom he first gave Dhamma would not even listen to the Buddha. They believed that liberation was impossible without practicing extreme bodily torture. The Buddha had already practised this. He had starved his body until it was a mere skeleton, too weak to take even two steps. Yet with his earlier practice of eight jhānas, he had seen that the deeper impurities still remained. Starving the body was a futile exercise, so he had given it up and started eating.<br/><br/>

To convince them he told them that he had witnessed the Four Noble Truths yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti: with experiential wisdom as they happen, not just intellectually or devotionally. Only then were they prepared at least to start listening to him.<br/><br/>

##### Dukkhasaccaṃ

**_—The Truth of Suffering_**<br/><br/>

**_dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ_**<br/><br/>

The Noble Truth of Suffering is now described, from the gross to the subtle.<br/><br/>

**_Jāti pi dukkhā, jarā pi dukkhā, (byādhi pi dukkhā,) maraṇaṃ pi dukkhaṃ, sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā pi dukkhā, appiyehi sampayogo pi dukkho, piyehi vippayogo pi dukkho, yampicchaṃ na labhati taṃ pi dukkhaṃ, saṅkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā_**.<br/><br/>

Each manifestation of dukkha is explained using synonyms.<br/><br/>

Jāti is birth in whatever plane of existence. Jarā is old age, frailty, the deterioration of the sense faculties. Byādhi is disease or sickness. Maraṇa is death from whatever plane of existence, and the dissolution of the aggregates. Soka is sorrow, mental grief from the loss of something very dear, and parideva is the crying and lamenting that results. Dukkha is bodily pain and unpleasant sensation. Domanassa is mental unpleasantness. Upāyāsa is mental distress and affliction following loss or misfortune. All these are dukkha.<br/><br/>

Both here and in other explanations, dukkha is used for unpleasant or painful bodily sensation, and domanassa (from mana, mind) for mental unpleasantness. It could be a thought, a memory, a fear. Similarly sukha is used for pleasant bodily sensation and somanassa for pleasant feeling in the mind. In vedanānupassanā the words dukkha and sukha vedanā are used, which is why this tradition strongly emphasises bodily sensations as the object of meditation.<br/><br/>

At a subtler level appiyehi sampayogo is association with anything unpleasant: rūpa, a vision, colour or light; sadda, sound; gandha, smell; rasa, taste; phoṭṭhabba, touch; or dhamma, a thought. Piyehi vippayogo is disassociation from anything pleasant. Disassociation from those who are dear, such as friends and family members, is dukkha<br/><br/>

Still subtler is icchaṃ na labhati: not getting what is desired. If someone desires to escape the cycle of birth, but does not reach this stage, it is na pattabbaṃ, not fulfilled. This is misery. Similarly desire arises to be free of old age, illness, death, and of all mental and physical grief and pain, and it is not fulfilled.<br/><br/>

Saṅkhittena, in summary, and at a still deeper level, the pañcupādānakkhandha, the upādāna, the attachment to the five aggregates, the pañca khandha—of rūpa, matter; vedanā, sensation; saññā, perception; saṅkhāra, reaction; and viññāṇa, consciousness—is misery.<br/><br/>

Devotional or logical acceptance of the First Noble Truth does not help: it has to be experienced (yathābhūtaṃpajānāti) to its final limit. This is done by the practice of sīla and samādhi, and with a concentrated mind you practice the observation of the subtler reality of the workings of the five khandhas and the six sense doors. This is the whole process of the Noble Eightfold Path.<br/><br/>

The initial solidified, intensified and painful sensations are obviously dukkha, but they have to be observed with equanimity because reaction to them will multiply the misery. By equanimity they are divided, dissected, disintegrated and dissolved, and even if pain remains, an undercurrent of vibrations is felt with it. When broken up by these wavelets it does not seem to be misery. When even this goes away, there is only a flow of very subtle vibrations, giving rise to pīti. This is still the field of dukkha, lacking any real happiness, because it is anicca, arising and passing. The first experience of bhaṅga is very important, just to realise the truth that the entire material structure is nothing but subatomic particles. If however it is regarded as freedom from misery, then the field of dukkha has not been fully covered. Unpleasant sensations will again come: partly because of the surfacing of deep past saṇkhāras, partly because of posture, illness, and the like. Every pleasant experience, because it is impermanent, has dukkha as its inherent nature.<br/><br/>

The next stage, passaddhi, tranquillity, containing no unpleasantness and apparently no dukkha, still has samudaya vaya present. Yet sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā—whatever gets composed is sooner or later bound to be destroyed. Gross experiences will still come, because this passaddhi is still a passing experience, still in the field of mind and matter. The entire field of dukkha is not complete. It can be said to be explored only when it is transcended to a stage beyond, where nothing arises or is created.<br/><br/>

Thus the understanding of dukkha at a gross level cannot be said to be a Noble Truth. Parijānāti (complete understanding) means exploring the entire field with direct experience. Only when it is pariññātaṃ (understood to its end) does it actually become a Noble Truth.<br/><br/>

##### Samudayasaccaṃ

**_—The Truth of the Arising of Suffering_**<br/><br/>

**_dukkhasamudayaṃ ariyasaccaṃ_**<br/><br/>

The Second Noble Truth is the arising of misery.<br/><br/>

**_Yāyaṃ taṇhā ponobbhavikā nandīrāgasahagatā tatratatrābhinandinī, seyyathidaṃ, kāmataṇhā bhavataṇhā vibhavataṇhā_**.

This is taṇhā, craving; ponobbhavikā, resulting in life after life; nandī-rāga-sahagatā, bound up with desire for pleasure; tatra-tatrābhinandinī, taking pleasure here and there; seyyathīdaṃ, that is:<br/><br/>

Kāma-taṇhā is sensual pleasure. Any little desire so quickly turns into craving, and predominant is sexual desire.<br/><br/>

Bhava-taṇhā is the desire to survive, even though the body and the entire universe are continually destroyed. Because of this ego, because of craving towards becoming, philosophies which espouse eternity seem attractive.<br/><br/>

Vibhava-taṇhā is the opposite in two ways. One is desiring this circle of life and death to stop, a stage which cannot be attained by such unbalanced craving. A second is refusing to accept the continuation of misery after death, while there are still saṅkhāras, out of fear of the results of the unwholesome actions of this life. There is an unbalanced craving and clinging to the philosophy that: "This is the only existence."<br/><br/>

These three taṇhās result in dukkha.<br/><br/>

Where then does this taṇhā arise and stay?<br/><br/>

**_Yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ etthesā taṇhā uppajjamānā uppajjati,<br/>
ettha nivisamānā nivisati_**.<br/><br/>

Craving arises (uppajjati) and stays (nivisati) wherever in the loka there is pleasure (loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ). Both piya and sāta mean "pleasant", "agreeable." One meaning of loka is "planes of existence," but here it means "within the framework of the body." A deva called Rohita once passed in front of the monastery where the Buddha was sitting, and this person was singing: Caraiveti, caraiveti, "Keep walking, keep walking." Questioned by the Buddha, Rohita said he was walking to explore the entire loka and then beyond. The Buddha smiled, and explained that the entire universe, its cause, its cessation, and the way to its cessation are within the framework of the body.<br/><br/>

Literally luñjati paluñjatīti loko—the loka is continually being destroyed. It arises and passes away. It is the entire field of mind and matter, and it is understood within the framework of the body. As you plant the seed of a particular plane of existence, you experience it. A very unwholesome saṅkhāra will result in hellfire within, both now and later, when the fruit comes. Planting the seed of a heavenly plane, you feel pleasant; of a brāhmic plane, you feel tranquil, both now and later. The stage of nibbāna also, where nothing arises or passes, has to be experienced within the body.<br/><br/>

Craving therefore arises wherever something pleasant is felt, within the framework of the body. Now details are given about where the craving arises.<br/><br/>

**_Cakkhu loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ, etthesā taṇhā uppajjamānā uppajjati, ettha nivisamānā nivisati… Sotaṃ… Ghānaṃ… Jivhā… Kāyo… Mano loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ, etthesā taṇhā uppajjamānā uppajjati, ettha nivisamānā nivisati_**.<br/><br/>

Craving arises and stays at the cakkhu—the eye sense-door—which is pleasant and agreeable.<br/><br/>

The same process occurs with ear, nose, tongue, body or mind.<br/><br/>

**_Rūpa… Saddā… Gandhā… Rasā… Phoṭṭhabbā… Dhammā… nivisati_**.<br/><br/>

Wherever pleasure is felt in the object, such as a vision, sound, smell, taste, touch or thought, craving arises and stays.<br/><br/>

**_Cakkhu-viññāṇaṃ… Sota-viññāṇaṃ… Ghāna-viññāṇaṃ… Jivhā-viññāṇaṃ… Kāya-viññāṇaṃ… Mano-viññāṇaṃ… nivisati._**<br/><br/>

Craving arises at any of the six viññāṇas of the sense doors. As a description of mind, the four aggregates of viññāṇa, saññā, vedanā, and saṅkhāra generally suffice. Deeper Vipassana separates them. Before that stage is reached however, philosophies start because, despite the experience of arising and passing, the observer—which is viññāṇa—seems to remain and it is not divided or dissected. It is viewed as eternal soul: je viññāya te āya ye āya te viññāya (Whatever is viññāṇa is soul and whatever is soul is viññāṇa). However at a deeper level it does become separated: eye viññāṇa cannot hear, ear viññāṇa cannot see, any or all of these viññāṇas can stop, and when mind viññāṇa also stops, nibbāna comes.<br/><br/>

The Buddha gives further details:<br/><br/>

**_Cakkhu-samphasso…<br/>
Cakkhu-samphassajā vedanā…<br/>
Rūpa-saññā…<br/>
Rūpa-sañcetanā…<br/>
Rūpa-taṇhā…<br/>
Rūpa-vitakko…<br/>
Rūpa-vicāro… nivisati_**.<br/><br/>

Because of contact (samphasso) at any sense door craving also arises and stays. Because of this contact there is a sensation (samphassajā vedanā) and again craving arises and stays. Then follows evaluation or perception (saññā) of the object of the sense door, and craving arises and stays. Sañcetanā (mental reaction) towards the object is a synonym of saṅkhāra: here again craving arises and stays. Then craving (taṇhā) arises and stays in relation to any of the sense objects. Initial application of thought to the object (vitakko) follows. Finally follows the rolling in the thought (vicāro). In every case the entire process happens at each of the six sense doors.<br/><br/>

This Second Noble Truth is called dukkha-samudaya. In general understanding it is true that taṇhā is the cause of suffering. However, samudaya means "arising," because suffering arises simultaneously with craving, with no time gap.<br/><br/>

---

##### Nirodhasaccaṃ

**_—The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering_**<br/><br/>

**_dukkhanirodhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ_**<br/><br/>

The Third Noble Truth is the total eradication of craving so that it does not arise again at all. "It is the complete fading away and cessation of this very craving, forsaking it and giving it up; the liberation from it, leaving no place for it."<br/><br/>

**_Yo tassāyeva taṇhāya asesavirāganirodho cāgo paṭinissaggo mutti anālayo_**.<br/><br/>

Where is this work done?<br/><br/>

**_Yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ, etthesā taṇhā pahīyamānā pahīyati, ettha nirujjhamānā nirujjhati_**.<br/><br/>

Wherever taṇhā (craving) arises and stays in the loke—the field of mind and matter—there it is to be eradicated (pahīyamānā pahīyati) and extinguished (nirujjhamānā nirujjhati). It must be worked on and totally eradicated at the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind sense doors. Details are now again given:<br/><br/>

**_Cakkhu… Sotaṃ… Ghānaṃ… Jivhā… Kāyo… Mano loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ, etthesā taṇhā pahīyamānā pahīyati, ettha nirujjhamānā nirujjhati_**.<br/><br/>

**_Rūpa… Saddā… Gandhā… Rasā… Phoṭṭhabbā… Dhammā… nirujjhati_**.<br/><br/>

**_Cakkhu-viññāṇaṃ…<br/>
Cakkhu-samphasso…<br/>
Cakkhu-samphassajā vedanā…<br/>
Rūpa-saññā…<br/>
Rūpa-sañcetanā…<br/>
Rūpa-taṇhā…<br/>
Rūpa-vitakko…<br/>
Rūpa-vicāro… nirujjhati_**.<br/><br/>

The cessation must be total, both in the six sense doors and their related objects. Again six viññāṇas precede both the contact and its resulting sensation. Then follow six saññās, which evaluates the sensation. Then there are six sañcetanās (volitional actions), that can also be called saṅkhāras. Taṇhā (craving) follows. Vitakko is the beginning of thought in reaction to the contact of object and sense door, or the beginning of remembering or thinking of the future, in relation to the contact. Vitakka is followed by vicāro which is continuous thinking, in relation to the object.<br/><br/>

This is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering. In this course such minute, detailed analysis at the experiential level is totally impossible, but the Sutta is a complete teaching. Its audience would have included those working on the third or fourth stage of nibbāna, from anāgāmī to arahant. At these high stages every detail is separated, and laid bare. You understand every little sensation that arises, how it relates to a particular sense door, and how to the object of the sense door. You understand now how it arises related to saññā, to sañcetanā, and to the saṅkhāra; and you understand how it ceases, related to this or that. At such a very high stage, each can be divided and dissected in minute detail. Now, and even at the stage of sotāpanna, the reality, although deep, is not that deep; therefore understanding whether or not there is craving or aversion as a result of some sensation—together with the understanding of anicca—is enough.<br/><br/>

---

##### Maggasaccaṃ

**_—The Truth of the Path_**<br/><br/>

**_dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṃ_**<br/><br/>

The Fourth Noble Truth is the Path for the eradication of suffering.<br/><br/>

**_ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, seyyathidaṃ, sammādiṭṭhi, sammāsaṅkappo, sammāvācā, sammākammanto, sammā-ājīvo, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati, sammāsamādhi_**.<br/><br/>

The Path is eightfold. Each part is now explained.<br/><br/>

- **Right understanding (sammādiṭṭhi) is:**<br/>
  **_dukkhe ñāṇaṃ, dukkhasamudaye ñāṇaṃ, dukkhanirodhe ñāṇaṃ, dukkhanirodhagāminiyā paṭipadāya ñāṇaṃ_**.<br/><br/>
  It is total experiential wisdom about misery, its arising, its cessation, and the path: yathā-bhūtaṃ pajānāti, proper understanding of the reality as it is.<br/><br/>

- **Right thoughts (sammāsaṅkappo) are:**<br/><br/>
  **_nekkhammasaṅkappo, abyāpādasaṅkappo, avihiṃsāsaṅkappo_**.<br/><br/>
  They are thoughts of renunciation, thoughts which are free of anger, and thoughts which are free from violence.<br/><br/>

- **Right speech (sammāvācā) is:**<br/><br/>

**_musāvādā veramaṇī, pisuṇāya vācāya veramaṇī, pharusāya vācāya veramaṇī, samphappalāpā veramaṇī_**.<br/><br/>
It is not false or hurtful. It is not back-biting or slander. Again understand that this must be yathā-bhūtaṃpajānāti. It must happen in your life. It must be experienced, along with the understanding that you are living a life of abstinence from false, hurtful, backbiting, or slanderous talk. Unless you are practising this, unless it is experienced, unless it is happening in your life, it is not sammā but micchā, merely an intellectual or emotional game. It must be yathā-bhūta.<br/><br/>

- **Right action (sammākammanto) is:**<br/><br/>
  **_pāṇātipātā veramaṇī, adinnādānā veramaṇī, kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇī_**.<br/><br/>
  It is abstinence at the bodily level (veramaṇī) from killing (pāṇātipātā), stealing (adinnādānā) or sexual misconduct (kāmesumicchācārā). This must also be experienced; it must happen in life. Only when you can say that you are living a life of abstinence from killing, stealing and sexual misconduct is it pajānāti, is it experienced as it is.<br/><br/>

- **Right livelihood (sammā-ājīvo) is**:<br/><br/>
  **_ariyasāvako micchā-ājīvaṃ pahāya sammā-ājīvena jīvitaṃ kappeti_**.<br/><br/>
  It is where unwholesome (micchā) livelihood has been given up (pahāya), and again the same applies: the earning of a livelihood by wholesome means must be experienced in life.<br/><br/>

- **Right effort (sammāvāyāmo) is fourfold**:<br/><br/>
  **_anuppannānaṃ pāpakānaṃ akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ anuppādāya…<br/>
  uppannānaṃ pāpakānaṃ akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānāya…<br/>
  anuppannānaṃ kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ uppādāya…<br/>
  uppannānaṃ kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ ṭhitiyā asammosāya bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya bhāvanāya pāripūriyā…_**<br/><br/>

**_…chandaṃ janeti vāyamati vīriyaṃ ārabhati cittaṃ paggaṇhāti padahati_**.<br/><br/>

It is to restrain unwholesome impurities (pāpakānaṃ akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ) which are anuppannānaṃ(unarisen). It is to remove uppannānaṃ (arisen) impurity. It is to awaken wholesomeness (kusalānaṃdhammānaṃ) which has not arisen. It is to retain, not to let fade, and to multiply arisen wholesomeness, up to its total fulfilment (bhāvanāya pāripūriyā).<br/><br/>

In each case the meditator "makes strong effort (chandaṃ janeti vāyamati), stirs up his energy (viriyaṃārabhati), applies his mind (cittaṃ paggaṇhāti) and strives (padahati)."<br/><br/>

- **Right awareness (sammāsati) is:**<br/><br/>

**_kaye kāyānupassī viharati… vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati… citte cittānupassī viharati… dhammesu dhammānu-passī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ_**.<br/><br/>

Wherever the Buddha describes sati, the description of the four fields of satipaṭṭhāna is repeated: that is, sampajañña, the experience of sensation arising and passing, must be present. Otherwise what is being practiced is not sammā-sati, but rather the ordinary awareness of a circus performer.<br/><br/>

- **Right concentration (sammāsamādhi) is the practice of four jhānas:**<br/><br/>

**_vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ…<br/><br/>
vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā ajjhattaṃ sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ avitakkaṃ avicāraṃ samādhijaṃpītisukhaṃ…<br/><br/>
pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati sato ca sampajāno sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṃvedeti yaṃ taṃ ariyā ācikkhanti ‘upekkhako satimā sukhavihārī’ti…<br/><br/>
sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃupekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ…_**<br/><br/>

In the first jhāna there is detachment from sense desires (kāmehi) and mental impurities. It is savitakkaṃsavicāraṃ: with attention to the object of meditation and with continual awareness of the object. There is detachment (vivekajaṃ) and pītisukhaṃ—a lot of mental pleasantness with pleasant sensation on the body. The mind is concentrated. In the second jhāna, vitakka-vicārānaṃ vūpasamā: the meditation object recedes, and there is pleasantness in the mind and body. In the third jhāna, mental pleasantness (pīti) recedes: there is only sukha, a pleasant bodily sensation from mental concentration. However sampajāna, the reality of arising and passing away, is now added.<br/><br/>

Understand that even before the Buddha became Buddha, the jhānas were present in India. He had learnt the seventh and eighth jhānas from two of his previous teachers. Yet here only four jhānas are taught. The reason is that in the jhānas which he had learnt previously, sampajañña was missing. As result, they could remove only the surface and slightly deeper impurities. Without sampajañña, they could not go to the depth and take out the deep-rooted impurities of the mind. These impurities remained, because of which the life continuum continued. Now with the practice of only four jhānas, in the third arising and passing are observed. Sampajañña is present.<br/><br/>

In the fourth jhāna, there is no more sukha or dukkha. Somanassa, and domanassa are gone. There is neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling in the mind. Only adukkhaṃasukhaṃ (tranquillity) remains, with upekkhā-sati-pārisuddhiṃ (equanimity, awareness and total purification). Sampajāno is not now used because this is the nibbānic stage. The fourth jhāna comes together with the fourth nibbānic stage of the arahant. Sampajañña was the Buddha’s contribution to the meditation practices of those days, the means with which to go beyond the entire field of mind and matter.<br/><br/>

This is the Fourth Noble Truth.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati…‘atthi dhamma’ ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati_**.<br/><br/>

The same stations recur: awareness is established in the truth of nothing but dhamma and then there is nothing to cling to.<br/><br/>

This entire explanation has to be experienced and understood. We can read it, but only with deeper experience does the meaning of the Buddha’s words become clear. At the stage of the arahant everything is clear by experience.<br/><br/>

---

##### Satipaṭṭhānabhāvanānisaṃso

**_—Results of the Practice_**<br/><br/>

Practising in this manner, one of two fruits is attained:<br/><br/>

**_diṭṭheva dhamme aññā, sati vā upādisese anāgāmitā_**.<br/><br/>

Either diṭṭheva dhamme aññā—the total understanding of an arahant—is attained, or the third stage of anāgāmī and that within seven years.<br/><br/>

Someone who has been practising more than seven years asks why they are not an arahant. The necessary condition however is evaṃ bhāveyya, having practised exactly as set out. It is sampajaññaṃ na riñcati, where sampajañña is not missed for any moment in life. Now you are preparing for this stage, practising feeling sensation in everything you do at the physical level, and understanding arising and passing. When you can practise in this way you have the Buddha’s guarantee of the results.<br/><br/>

Further the Buddha says, leave aside seven years, six years, five, four, and even down to one year; then seven months, six, and down to one, even half a month, or even seven days will suffice. It differs depending on the past accumulation, even if sampajañña is practised every moment. It might be seven years, yet practising the same technique there were instances where someone experienced nibbāna after just a few minutes, like the person who came from Bombay and was taught only the words diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṃ bhavissati.<br/><br/>

Some meditators start with walking, even mentally repeating "walking", "itching", or whatever. There is no paññā: but at least the practice concentrates the mind. Those with a strong sex desire, go to a cemetery—or nowadays an autopsy—to balance their minds somewhat. Whatever the starting point, the meditator must experience sensations as arising and passing. At this point your sampajañña may be only for a few seconds, and then forgotten for minutes or even hours together. With continual work, later you will forget sampajañña only briefly, then not even for a moment. That stage may take a long time, but after that the limit is seven years.<br/><br/>

Then come the closing words:<br/><br/>

**_‘Ekāyano ayaṃ, bhikkhave, maggo sattānaṃ visuddhiyā, sokaparidevānaṃ samatikkamāya, dukkhadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamāya, ñāyassa adhigamāya, nibbānassa sacchikiriyāya yadidaṃ cattāro satipaṭṭhānā’ti. Iti yaṃ taṃ vuttaṃ, idametaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ ti_**.<br/><br/>

"It is for this reason that it was said: ‘This is the one and only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the extinguishing of suffering and grief, for walking on the path of truth, for the realisation of nibbāna: that is to say, the fourfold establishing of awareness.’"<br/><br/>

Ekāyano maggo is not a sectarian claim, but a law of nature. The path helps not only those who call themselves Buddhists or have implicit faith: it is to be experienced by one and all, practising with and so transcending sensation. Whether or not there is a Buddha, universal law exists. The earth is round; gravity does exist whether or not Galileo or Newton discovers it. Similarly the arising and eradication of misery is a law. Just as two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen make water: so, when in deep ignorance there is a reaction of craving or aversion, misery arises. This is not Hindu, Buddhist or Christian law, but simply the law. Similarly if there is full awareness and sampajañña, understanding of the entire truth, there is liberation. Intellectual understanding can only give inspiration and guidance. Without even this, those of different views cannot explore and experience the truth. Someone might assert that the earth is flat, or that gravity does not exist, but nothing will change for them.<br/><br/>

Fire will burn your hand. This truth can be experienced. To avoid it, keep your hand away from fire. In exactly the same way, reacting to sensations causes misery. If you stop reacting and just observe their arising and passing, naturally your practice will extinguish misery, the fire of craving and aversion, just as water extinguishes fire. This is ekāyano maggo—the law, truth, or nature for one and all.<br/><br/>

##### Questions and Answers<br/><br/>

Every word of the Sutta will become clear as you practise and reach the final goal. At this stage, many questions keep coming. Even if the Teacher’s answers satisfy you intellectually, doubt may wash them away. You are only imagining, not seeing. Practise. In every course, as you keep experiencing Dhamma, you hear the same discourses, the same words, but you find something new each time. Real understanding, clear and free from any doubt or scepticism, comes with your own experience.<br/><br/>

**Q. You mentioned noting various mental states arising. How should you deal with, say, anger or fantasy**?<br/><br/>

**A**. Noting anger, fear, passion, ego or any kind of impurity does not mean mentally reciting them. Noting may help you concentrate and understand somewhat, but sampajañña is missing. Just accept the mental content, that your mind is with, say, anger—sadosaṃ vā cittaṃ pajānāti—and observe any predominant sensation, with the understanding of arising and passing. Any sensation at that time will be connected to the anger.<br/><br/>

**Q. From where do kalāpas arise and to what do they pass away? Something cannot come from nothing**.<br/><br/>

**A**. Whence did the universe start, and how was it created? This is speculation, how all philosophies start. The Buddha called them all irrelevant questions. They have nothing to do with misery, its arising, its eradication, and the way to its eradication. Creation is going on every moment: kalāpas are created, they arise and pass, and ignorance of this arising and passing results in misery. Anything else is meaningless. Human life is short and you have such a big job to change the habit pattern of the mind at the deepest level and reach full liberation. Don’t waste your time: work, and the reality of your experience will later on reveal everything.<br/><br/>

**Q. What is the cause behind the existence of this world of mind and matter**?<br/><br/>

**A**. Ignorance generates saṅkhāras, and saṅkhāras multiply ignorance. The entire universe is created by this mutual support, nothing else.<br/><br/>

**Q. How did ignorance begin? It could not co-exist with love, wisdom, and knowledge**.<br/><br/>

**A**. Certainly, but it is more important to see the ignorance of this moment and let purity come. Otherwise it becomes a philosophical question, which doesn’t help.<br/><br/>

**Q. Did the Buddha teach outside India, in Myanmar**?<br/><br/>

**A**. There is no evidence that he taught outside the Ganga-Jamuna area of northern India.<br/><br/>

**Q. With respect, how can we say that the Buddha rediscovered the lost technique when he was taught it and took his vow in front of a previous Buddha**?<br/><br/>

**A**. Many who meet a Buddha become inspired and desire not just to liberate themselves, but also to become a Sammā-sambuddha and help liberate many others. Expressing this desire, their mental capacity can be examined by the then Sammā-sambuddha: whether having already worked countless aeons they would, if now given Vipassana, very soon become arahants: and whether even though knowing this they still wish to develop their pāramīs to the necessary extent over countless further aeons. If so, they receive not just a blessing but a time prediction. The ascetic who later was born as Gotama, was capable of reaching the stage of an arahant then, but did not take Vipassana.<br/><br/>

In his last life, with darkness all around, words highly praising Vipassana still existed in the ancient Ṛg-Veda, but were mere recitations. The practice was lost. Due to his past pāramīs he went to the depth and discovered it. He said pubbe ananussutesu dhammesu cakkhuṃ udapādi: "My eye is opened in a dhamma which I had never heard before." Later he called it purāṇo maggo, an ancient path. He rediscovered and distributed a dormant, forgotten path.<br/><br/>

**Q. Does an entity with saṅkhāras causing rebirth have any choice in the circumstances, or is it actually determined by past saṅkhāras**?<br/><br/>

**A**. The past saṅkhāras which are responsible for life in the lower fields are so powerful that at the time of death one of these will arise and generate a vibration which is in tune with the vibration of a particular plane; in that way you are sucked to deeper levels of misery. If however Vipassana has been properly practised, even with such saṅkhāras the Vipassana vibration is so strong that at the last mind moment this arises and connects with a plane where Vipassana can be practised, instead of a lower field. So in another way you can choose not to go down.<br/><br/>

**Q. If the "I" is non-existent, an illusion, how can "I" be reincarnated**?<br/><br/>

**A**. Nothing is incarnated. There is a continuous flow of mind and matter: every moment saṅkhāra-paccayā viññāṇaṃ. At death the push of some deep saṅkhāra causes viññāṇa to arise with some other body.<br/><br/>

**Q. If the reward for achieving nibbāna is bodily death, why practise to die**?<br/><br/>

**A**. It is not annihilation, but a wonderful art of dying. It is also an art of living, coming out of impurities to lead a healthy life. When you experience nibbāna, it is something like death: the sense doors do not work, but you are fully awakened inside. Experience it. The question will be answered automatically.<br/><br/>

**Q. Where does a liberated person live without rebirth**?<br/><br/>

**A**. Many such questions were asked of the Buddha. What happens to the arahant after death is what is experienced by the arahant in life. Experiencing the fourth stage of nibbāna they understand that this is the ultimate stage, which also happens after death. It cannot be explained in words because it is beyond mind and matter. Something beyond the sensory field cannot be expressed by the sense organs. A fourth dimensional experience cannot be represented within three dimensions. The proof is in eating the cake.<br/><br/>

**Q. Can an enlightened married person still have children**?<br/><br/>

**A**. Passion naturally becomes weaker as you proceed and yet you feel so contented and happy. Why worry about it? Come to that stage and the question will get answered.<br/><br/>

**Q. Is there a preferred order to list the ten pāramīs**?<br/><br/>

**A**. It is more important to develop them: the order doesn’t matter.<br/><br/>

**Q. Since Vipassana is widespread, are sotāpannas, anāgāmīs and arahants to be found today**?<br/><br/>

**A**. The number of meditators today is just a drop in an ocean of billions of people, and most are at the kindergarten stage: there are cases of meditators who have experienced nibbāna, but very few.<br/><br/>

**Q. Without offence, are you, Goenka, fully enlightened**?<br/><br/>

**A**. I am not an arahant, but without doubt on the path to becoming one. Having taken a few more steps on the path than all of you, I am competent to teach you. Walk on the path and reach the goal: that is more important than examining your teacher!<br/><br/>

**Q. Who was Ledi Sayadaw’s teacher? You frequently mention the tradition where vedanā is fundamental: what is the name of this tradition**?<br/><br/>

**A**. There is no recorded history, but Ledi Sayadaw says that he learnt this technique from a monk in Mandalay. The tradition existed even before Ledi Sayadaw. Out of his many students, some started teaching and also gave importance to vedanā. Saya Thet taught Sayagyi U Ba Khin, among other teachers, and Sayagyi U Ba Khin had a number of students who started teaching. One is here and he gives importance to vedanā. This tradition gives importance to vedanā.<br/><br/>

**Q. About chanting…**<br/><br/>

**A**. Chanting is part of the duty of a Teacher, to give good vibrations, to protect the work of the students from any bad vibrations from outside. The students’ job is to practise and observe, which is why they are not asked to chant. At a certain stage some are taught: between each word you are aware of sensations with anicca, with sampajañña very clearly in every pause. This, not mere chanting, gives the Dhamma vibration. It becomes part of the constant meditation of sampajañña. Otherwise mere chanting, which looks so easy, is just a rite, ritual or religious ceremony.<br/><br/>

**Q. If not the ego, which part of the being can give or receive mettā?**<br/><br/>

**A**. Vipassana takes you to the ultimate truth, but the Buddha wanted you to be aware of both this and the apparent truth. Both this wall and my head are ultimately vibrations but apparently solid. The wall will still break my head on impact! Ultimately there is no being, but you still give up unwholesome actions—such as hatred, aversion, ill-will, and animosity—because they harm you. Generating mettā, love, compassion and goodwill, makes your mind better, and helps you to reach the final goal.<br/><br/>

**Q. It appears that your interpretation of the text is not as literal as it could be. How do you know that your interpretation is correct and what the Buddha intended**?<br/><br/>

**A**. The language is twenty-five centuries old, and meanings change. Even if they do not, what the Buddha said with his experience cannot be understood without that experience. Many translators have never practised. We are not here to quarrel with or condemn other interpretations of the Buddha’s words. As you practise, you will understand what the Buddha meant; and for now you must accept whatever you do experience.<br/><br/>

Commentaries were written on the Buddha’s words, some over 1,000 years after his death, although our research reveals that Vipassana in its pure form was lost 500 years after his death. Others were written within 500 years, but were lost except in Sri Lanka: they were again translated into Pāli, but with the translator’s own interpretation. They give a clear picture of Indian society in the Buddha’s time: the whole spectrum of its social, political, educational, cultural, religious and philosophical background. They often unravel obscure words by giving many synonyms. Yet while they are very helpful, if their words differ from our experience, and if in the Buddha’s words we find a clear, direct explanation, then without condemning the commentaries, we have to accept the Buddha’s explanation of our experience.<br/><br/>

For instance, one tradition takes vedanā as only mental. It is true that vedanā is a mental aggregate and that vedanānupassanā has to be mental. But in several places the Buddha talks of sukha and dukkha vedanā on the body, as in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, whereas somanassa and domanassa vedanā are used for the mind.<br/><br/>

Some translations in English of the word sampajañña, such as "clear comprehension," have created much confusion. This suggests sati without sampajañña, the understanding with perfect paññā. In the Buddha’s words, viditā vedanā uppajjati, you feel sensation coming up. Mere awareness is all right just as a start: for instance, an itch is just felt and labelled, with no understanding of anicca—but this is not sampajañña.<br/><br/>

Similarly sati parimukhaṃ has been translated "keeping the attention in front." People start imagining their attention to be in front, outside the body, and the technique of kāye kāyānupassī, vedanāsu vedanānupassī—in the body, in the sensations—is lost. When our experience differs from the beliefs of other traditions, we take shelter in the Buddha’s words.<br/><br/>

The Vipassana Research Institute has been established to go through all the Buddha’s words using computers; the volume of the literature is huge. Instead of remembering instances of, say, vedanā or sampajāno in 40 - 50 volumes of 300 - 400 pages each, computers are used to find the usages for examination. If differences result, we can’t help it, but nor do we insist that idaṃ saccaṃ, "this only is the truth." There is no attachment. I understand from my direct experience of the words of the Buddha, and from this line of teachers, including those who reached very high stages. Their experience was the same. Similarly thousands of meditators around the world have had the same experience. I am therefore confident that this teaching is correct and the Buddha’s way. If in doubt, practice: only practice will remove the doubts. If this technique does not suit you intellectually, then work with something else, but don’t keep mixing, running here and there. If you find results with this technique, go deeper and all your questions will be answered. Even having learnt just a little Pāli, the words of the Buddha will become clear in time. You feel he is directing you. Rather than unnecessary intellectual activity, or arguments and debates, experience will clarify.<br/><br/>

---

You have come to a Satipaṭṭhāna course to experience, and not just to hear the Buddha’s words or a particular teacher’s interpretation. Having taken three or more courses before joining, now keep going deeper so that the Buddha’s words become clear by experience. Free yourselves from all these saṅkhāras and start experiencing real liberation. May all of you reach the final goal of full nibbāna.<br/><br/>

You are taking right steps on the right path: although long, it doesn’t matter. Taking the first, the second, and in this way step by step you are bound to reach the final goal. May all of you enjoy the real happiness and peace of liberation.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy**.
