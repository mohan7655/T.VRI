The first day of the Satipaṭṭhāna course is over. The technique, and your practice, remain the same. It is however a special course in the sense that you will try to understand the words of the Buddha with reference to the technique. All the teachings, all the discourses of the Buddha are so enlightening, full of wisdom, so precious, just like portions of a big, sweet cake. Every one of them gives the same taste of nectar, ambrosia. The Mahā-satipaṭṭhāna Sutta however is chosen because it deals with this technique in detail.<br/><br/>

It is better for serious old students to hear the actual words of the Buddha, to understand both practice and theory more clearly, in more detail, and to come out of any confusion. A few enthusiastic students unfortunately started teaching without proper training or grounding in the technique, and mixed other things with it. In Indiathey attended just a few courses. They mostly had great attachment to their own sectarian philosophical beliefs and no technique of their own. With only superficial knowledge of Vipassana, they were unable to teach it properly. Vipassana students who attended their courses got very confused.<br/><br/>

Similarly in the West, people have started teaching with a base of this technique, but differently. Just to differentiate they claim to teach Satipaṭṭhāna, and say that what Goenka teaches is Vipassana. This caused great confusion. Satipaṭṭhāna is Vipassana. Vipassana is Satipaṭṭhāna. The direct words of the Buddha will clarify this. They will give inspiration and guidance, and the understanding of Dhamma at a deeper level. Therefore the technique remains the same but the evening discourses will cover this very important Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta in detail.<br/><br/>

Initially Pāli, the ancient language spoken by the Buddha, will seem very new to you. Slowly you will start understanding the words. Later you will be able to develop a working knowledge of the language. Then it becomes so inspiring. If you are a good Vipassana meditator you will feel as if the words are for you, that the Buddha himself is directing your practice. At this beginning stage, understand just a few words, which will be helpful.<br/><br/>

##### The Three Steps

There are three aspects, or important steps of Dhamma. The first is **pariyatti**: sufficient intellectual knowledge of the teaching. Those who have not even heard or read the words of the Enlightened Person cannot understand Dhamma and its universal nature. They will understand Dhamma only as Buddhist religion. They will take it as a sectarian philosophical belief, or a rite, ritual, or religious ceremony, such as they themselves remain involved in. A sutavā is one who has heard and will understand Dhamma as universal law, truth, nature, not limited to any sect or community. Having heard, a sutavā can practise and apply it in life, and so is a fortunate person compared to an assutavā, who has heard nothing about universal truth, and remains confused.<br/><br/>

Hearing or reading words of pure Dhamma is very good to give inspiration and guidance to start practising. However if you remain satisfied just with that and don’t practise, because now you feel you know everything at the intellectual level, then it becomes just a devotional game. Actually you don’t know because direct experience is missing. You have just accepted the truth without practising, which may even become a hindrance to liberation. Therefore every sutavā must start practising.<br/><br/>

**Paṭipatti**, the next step, is practising Dhamma. In another discourse the Buddha said:<br/>

**_Supaṭipanno Bhagavato sāvaka-saṅgho._**<br/><br/>

Sāvaka means sutavā. Sāvaka-saṅgho means the saṅgha which is sāvaka, which has heard the teaching of the Buddha and started walking on the path properly—that is, supaṭipanno, "well practiced." Walking on the path they will reach the final destination of full liberation. Paṭipatti will do this, not pariyatti alone. With pariyatti you start understanding that as a human being, as a social being, you must live a life of morality in your family and in society. If you disturb the peace and harmony of others, how can you experience peace and harmony? So you abstain from any physical or vocal action which hurts and harms other beings. You abstain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, harsh words, backbiting or useless, meaningless words which waste your time and that of others, and from taking any kind of intoxicant. You also understand that by abstaining from unwholesome actions you are actually obliging yourself, not only others. Such unwholesome actions cannot be performed unless you generate great impurity in the mind; like craving, greed, aversion, ego, and fear. When you do that, you harm yourself. For this reason you understand the importance of sīla, which means "morality."<br/><br/>

However even with your intellectual understanding, maintaining sīla becomes difficult without control over the mind. Therefore you must practise samādhi, that is mastery of the mind. In certain circumstances, such as the environment of a Vipassana course, it is easy not to break your sīla, but walking on the path you have to develop this mastery. You start becoming supaṭipanno. Now you are practising using Ānāpāna, awareness of your respiration, which is paṭipatti.<br/><br/>

As you proceed on the path properly, as an enlightened person intends you to, you have to control the mind in a proper way, or this control will not take you to the third step of **paṭivedhana**. Literally this means "piercing, penetrating." Your samādhi concentrates the mind on the reality pertaining to yourself, your own mind-matter phenomenon, because respiration is related to both mind and matter. However, as you proceed you will notice a great stock of accumulated impurities inside. Although you try to control your physical and vocal actions, yet you get overwhelmed by them from time to time. Therefore you have to reach that depth of truth which will take these impurities out.<br/><br/>

Paññatti is apparent truth: it seems to be, it appears to be so. To witness ultimate truth you have to remove this curtain of apparent truth, pierce, penetrate, and cut it asunder. This is Vipassana. In another text it was said:<br/>

**_Paññatti ṭhapetvā visesena passatī’ti vipassanā._**<br/><br/>

Paññatti ṭhapetvā means "having removed the apparent truth." Then Vipassana sees (passati) things by their characteristic (visesena). By piercing, penetrating the apparent, solidified, intensified truth, which has to be dissected, disintegrated, dissolved, you move towards the ultimate truth of what is called "I," "mine," the material structure, the mental structure, and the mental contents. Then piercing the entire field of mind and matter you can witness something beyond—the ultimate truth of nibbāna, which is eternal, beyond the entire field of mind and matter. This practice of piercing wisdom, paṭivedhana, which is Vipassana, leads to the final goal of full liberation.<br/><br/>

Therefore understand that the purpose of hearing this Sutta during the course is not merely for pariyatti. However helpful this theoretical knowledge might be, all three steps of pariyatti, paṭipatti, and paṭivedhana have to be taken. These three cover the entire universe of paññā, that is wisdom.<br/><br/>

In ten-day courses you have heard about the three stages of paññā. Suta-mayā paññā is what you have heard. It is someone else’s wisdom, not yours. Cintā-mayā paññā is your intellectual reasoning, your understanding of someone else’s wisdom. Both are good, but only if you take the third step of bhāvanā-mayā paññā, to witness the truth yourself. Repeated witnessing develops your wisdom and it is this direct experience that takes you to the final goal.<br/><br/>

Different words for this threefold distinction are used in another Indian tradition. First is **sadda sacca**, truth of the word. Fanatics think that the truth of the scriptures must be accepted even without understanding it. When witnessed, experienced, it may be true, but they have merely heard and developed attachment. It is not truth for them. Next is **anumāna sacca**, intellectual understanding by inference. From smoke you infer fire. You have not seen the fire. Both of these can be illusionary, delusionary.<br/><br/>

Third is the truth you directly witness yourself: **paccakkha sacca**. The entire teaching of an enlightened person is to inspire you to do this. Belief in the Buddha’s words is essential, but unless you yourself witness the truth you can never become enlightened. To listen and understand intellectually is very helpful, but at the same time every teaching has to be witnessed by those who aspire to get liberated. This is what is taught in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, and its every word should inspire and guide you.<br/><br/>

##### Sati—Awareness

Sati means awareness, the witnessing of every reality pertaining to mind and matter within the framework of the body. Only with proper understanding and wisdom does it become satipaṭṭhāna. Ṭhāna means getting established. Paṭṭhāna means getting established in a proper way, which is in different ways, or pakārena:<br/>

**_Pakārena jānātī’ti paññā._**<br/><br/>

Paññā, wisdom, jānāti, understands, reality from different angles. Witnessing from only one angle is partial, distorted truth. You have to try to witness the totality, which is done by observing from different angles. Then it is pakārena, and it becomes paññā.<br/><br/>

Thus sati becomes paṭṭhāna when it is joined with paññā. Whenever the Buddha uses the words sati or sato, he also uses sampajāno, as in the Sutta:<br/> **_ātāpī sampajāno satimā_**<br/><br/>

Ātāpī means "ardently." However sati is perfect only with wisdom, sampajāno, with the understanding of the nature of reality at the experiential level—that is, its basic characteristic of anicca, arising and passing. Because its nature is to be impermanent, the characteristic of dukkha, misery or suffering, is also inherent. Practising with paññā, you will understand dukkha with your own experience. Every pleasant experience, every pleasant situation is anicca.<br/><br/>

Everything within the framework of the body changes into something unpleasant, so it is nothing but dukkha. The law of nature is such. Yet the tendency of the mind is to get attached and cling to a pleasant experience, and when it is gone you feel so miserable. This is not a philosophy but a truth to be experienced by paṭivedhana: dividing, dissecting, disintegrating, dissolving you reach the stage of bhaṅga, total dissolution. You witness the solidified, material structure, the body, as actually nothing but subatomic particles, kalāpas, arising and passing. Similarly the mind and mental contents manifest as very solidified, intensified emotions—anger, fear, or passion—which overpower you. Vipassana, paṭivedhana, helps you. With piercing, penetrating paññā you divide, dissect, disintegrate to the stage where this intense emotion is nothing but wavelets. The whole material and mental structures and the mental contents are nothing but wavelets, wavelets, anicca, anicca.<br/><br/>

Then the reality about this "I" or "mine" or "myself" becomes clear. They are just conventional words. There is no "I" to possess this mind-matter structure, these material and mental phenomena. Mere mind and matter constantly interact, constantly influence each other, and become a cause for the arising of each other, resulting in currents, cross-currents, and under-currents going on in what you call "I." Anattā becomes clear at the experiential level.<br/><br/>

Anicca, dukkha, anattā—that is, impermanence, misery, and egolessness—should not just be taken as a sectarian philosophy. They don’t apply just to Buddhists. Everyone, man or woman, of any colour or religion, is merely a constant interaction of mind and matter. Out of ignorance, enormous attachment develops to this false ego, this "I," which brings nothing but misery.<br/><br/>

The law of nature becomes so clear with paṭivedhana, with piercing, penetrating paññā. Without this, mere awareness will not help because you will always remain with the apparent truth, and you won’t understand the real, ultimate truth. A circus girl on a tightrope is very aware of every step she takes. Her life and parts of her body are in danger. Still she is far from liberation, because she is only with apparent truth, not with paññā inside. The sati is not perfect, because it has to be established with the wisdom of anicca, dukkha, anattā at the experiential level. Satipaṭṭhāna is sati with paññā. Then it plays a very important part in the practice of Dhamma, of witnessing the truth. The Satipaṭṭhāna discourse is for this purpose.<br/><br/>

In the ordinary ten-day discourses, you hear of five friends: saddhā, faith; viriya, effort; sati, awareness; samādhi, concentration; and paññā, wisdom. They were called indriyas by the Buddha. Indra means "ruler," "king." It is the name of the king of the celestial world. The sense doors are one type of indriya: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and body. They are called this because they keep mastering and overpowering us. The five friends, or faculties which we master, are another type, and sati is one of these. These indriyas were also called "forces" or "strengths" (balas). For every meditator these five are very important strengths, and sati is among them. It is so important. Sati is also a very important factor of enlightenment. With every one of the seven factors of enlightenment you start with awareness, and you are aware of it till you reach the final goal. However sati is important and fruitful only if used properly, as explained by the Buddha in the teachings of this Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.<br/><br/>

##### Pariyatti—Theoretical Knowledge

Tomorrow we will start reading this sutta. The background given today is to help you understand that practice is most important. There is a great danger that just reading or hearing suttas or discourses may become a life aim. Great care should be taken that the purpose of a Vipassana centre remains paṭipatti and paṭivedhana, the wisdom that is developed and multiplied by experience: little by little, step by step, as you divide, dissect, disintegrate, dissolve and piercingly, penetratingly move from the apparent truth towards the ultimate truth.<br/><br/>

One reason, out of many, why Vipassana got lost in India after the time of the Buddha was because theory and suttas alone were given importance. People felt satisfied just reciting a discourse, or reciting, memorising the entire Tipiṭaka—the teachings of the Buddha—as if the purpose of their life was fulfilled. Then came discussions, debates, arguments about the meaning of words. Confusion prevailed, and without practice there was no understanding. The words of an enlightened person are words of experience, to guide people to witness the truth. Playing games with them creates a great hindrance. Therefore we use the Buddha’s words to understand how he wanted us to practise. They give inspiration and guidance, but the actual practice remains predominant.<br/><br/>

Of course we are not denouncing pariyatti. How can one who is practising what the Buddha taught be against the words of the Buddha? However the practice, not the words, should remain the main aim of our life. We are very thankful to the Saṅgha who maintained the purity of the words of the Buddha and those among them who maintained the practice of Vipassana; otherwise it would have been lost long ago. Because of this tradition of ours we received the practice in its pristine purity and we are deeply grateful. Similarly we have great gratitude to those who, whether or not they practised, at least maintained the words of the Buddha from teacher to pupil for twenty-five centuries.<br/><br/>

Now so many queries arise about the Buddha’s teaching. Is this the Buddha’s teaching or not? Proof is possible only because of those in the Saṅgha of this school who felt responsible for keeping the Buddha’s words intact. So they are called Dhammabhaṇḍāgārikas, treasurers of the Dhamma—that is, of the words of the Buddha. As a result we can compare the words with the results from the practice of the technique.<br/><br/>

Therefore let both pariyatti and paṭipatti be joined together. Pariyatti gives us confidence that our practice is as the Buddha wanted, in the proper way.<br/><br/>

Now this Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta will be studied. If someone wants to study the entire Tipiṭaka it is wonderful. Every word is nectar, gives personal guidance, and is so clear and inspiring. However this is not necessary. Proper understanding of a few suttas is good enough. The Buddha said that even one gāthā or verse of two lines, if understood properly, is good enough for the final goal. A literal meaning of pariyatti, or pariyapti in Sanskrit and Hindi, is "sufficient." For some a larger number of discourses is sufficient. The words of the Buddha that you get in the evening discourses on a course are pariyatti. You understand how to practise properly, and why in this way, and you develop confidence in the steps you are taking. A few suttas, discourses, can be discussed in the evening discourses at centres, for understanding, but that should not be the main aim. Otherwise they will just become pariyatti centres: for teaching the Tipiṭaka, for discussion, recitation and debate, and also for emotional, devotional and intellectual games.<br/><br/>

This is therefore a warning to those who manage such centres around the world, now and for centuries in the future: it is essential that the teaching and practice of Vipassana always remain the main activity, because the final goal will be reached only when you take steps on the path.<br/><br/>

Therefore from tomorrow evening we will recite the sutta, to understand paṭipatti and paṭivedhana, the practical aspect, properly. We are on the right path, a path without diversion or deviation, a straight path to the final goal, without wasting time here and there on side issues.<br/><br/>

The practice remains the same. Now you are practising Ānāpāna, observing the truth of the breath. This is sati. Breath is the nature of a living being, not merely because a book or your teacher or the Buddha says so. You are witnessing it, coming in, going out, as it is. It is not a breathing exercise. You don’t regulate it but just observe. Naturally your mind starts getting concentrated. The breath becomes finer, shorter. Then it just makes a U-turn as it comes in or goes out, and at times it seems to stop. Again a big breath comes, out of hunger for oxygen and you are just aware. Again it becomes short, makes a U-turn, stops. You do nothing. Whether it is a long breath, or a short breath, you are just aware. Of course at times when you can’t feel the subtle breath, you may have a few intentional, conscious breaths, just to feel the natural breath again.<br/><br/>

This course is only eight days long, so time is short. Use it most seriously. You have a wonderful advantage here in that new students who often don’t understand the value of discipline and silence, and who in their confusion disturb others, are not allowed on the course. As mature old students of at least a few courses you understand the work, and you understand that continuity of practice is the secret of success. If you keep stopping your work out of laziness, wandering, roaming about or lying down and sleeping, you can’t reach the goal. Of course your mind will wander away, but you bring it back. Your effort must be continuous. Even the so-called recess periods, including the night-time, are for serious work, for meditation, for awareness. Sati must get established—satipaṭṭhāna. Now with Ānāpāna, you are aware of respiration. Sitting, standing, walking, lying down; bathing, washing, eating, drinking—day and night, except only the period of deep sleep, you are aware of natural breath. The sati gets paṭṭhāna. Awareness gets well established. Then in Vipassana the awareness, day and night, is of arising and passing, anicca.<br/><br/>

All the rules are so important. A course like this without new students and with minimum disturbance, where everybody is so serious, is very rare. Make best use of this opportunity, this facility, to get your awareness established with wisdom, to come nearer and nearer to the final goal. Make best use of this wonderful technique. Make best use of Dhamma for your own good, benefit, and liberation from the bondages, shackles and chains of craving, aversion, and ignorance. May you all enjoy real peace, harmony and happiness.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy.**
