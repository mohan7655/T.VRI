The sixth day of the Satipaṭṭhāna course is over. We proceed further with Dhammānupassanā. Dhammas are mental contents and their nature, the universal law of nature. A Buddha, an enlightened person, has no interest in establishing a sect or religion. Having discovered ultimate truth at the deepest level, the Buddha teaches this law to help people understand reality and end their misery, whatever their sect, community, country, colour or gender. The entire universe, animate and inanimate, everyone and everything, is governed by this law. With or without the Buddha, it governs the constant interaction of mind and matter, the currents, undercurrents and cross-currents going on in each individual. Yet people keep on playing games at the surface of the mind, deluding themselves in ignorance and multiplying their misery by multiplying their bondages.<br/><br/>

##### Khandhapabbaṃ

**_—The Aggregates_**<br/><br/>

**_dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu upādānakkhandhesu_**<br/><br/>

Khandha means an aggregate, an accumulation, or a heap of something. We are called individual beings. This is an apparent truth: but at a deeper level every living individual—I, you, he, or she—is just pañca khandhā, the five aggregates. The Buddha wants you to go to the depth of this reality, where you cannot differentiate or identify by name, where they are merely the five aggregates.<br/><br/>

One aggregate is the countless, subatomic material particles, kalāpas, joined together as matter. Mind is divided into another four aggregates: viññāṇa cognises; saññā recognises and evaluates; vedanā feels; and saṅkhāra reacts and creates. These five aggregates combined are called an entity, an individual. At the ultimate level they are just five aggregates and the whole process of Satipaṭṭhāna, of Vipassana, is to experience this fact. Otherwise the delusion of identifying "I," "mine," or "myself" with any or all of these aggregates—which is ignorance—causes tremendous attachment and clinging to them, resulting in great misery. This is not a belief to be accepted out of devotion, just because an enlightened person said it, nor a philosophy just to be intellectually accepted as rational and logical. It is a truth to be experienced and realised at the actual level within the framework of the body. When this truth becomes clear, the habit pattern at the deepest level of the mind changes, and liberation is reached. This is Dhamma, the law.<br/><br/>

Upādāna means attachment and clinging. This develops towards the five aggregates, which are its object; or, the five aggregates are generated and come together because of upādāna. They are aggregates of attachment.<br/><br/>

Again a meditator observes dhamma in dhamma, the five aggregates. How does a meditator practise with them?<br/><br/>

**_…‘iti rūpaṃ, iti rūpassa samudayo, iti rūpassa atthaṅgamo…_**<br/><br/>

This is matter, this is the arising of matter, this is the passing away of matter: all this is experienced. Rūpa means matter, samudaya means arising, atthaṅgamo passing away.<br/><br/>

**_iti vedanā, iti vedanāya samudayo, iti vedanāya atthaṅgamo;<br/>
iti saññā, iti saññāya samudayo, iti saññāya atthaṅgamo;<br/>
iti saṅkhārā, iti saṅkhārānaṃ samudayo, iti saṅkhārānaṃ atthaṅgamo;<br/>
iti viññāṇaṃ, iti viññāṇassa samudayo, iti viññāṇassa atthaṅgamo’ti_**.<br/><br/>

As the mental aggregates also are experienced—sensation (vedanā), perception (saññā), reaction (saṅkhāra), and consciousness (viññāṇa)—the whole process of what is happening inside is realised.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati,…‘atthi dhamma’ti…_**<br/><br/>

The same stations follow, inside, outside, both together. Then "atthi dhammā’ti,"—"Oh, this is Dhamma." Awareness gets established in the reality that these five aggregates are all there is. A high stage of observation finds mere mind and matter, nothing else—no "I," "mine," or "myself."<br/><br/>

At the apparent, conventional level, the words "I" and "you" have to be used, but at the actual, ultimate level there are just the five khandhas. Similarly for conventional purposes, we call something joined together a motor car, but if we disintegrate it and separate its parts, which part is the car? the tyres? the wheels? the seats? the engine? the battery? the body? Actually a car is just different parts joined together.<br/><br/>

Similarly, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday when joined make a week; thirty days joined together make a month; and twelve months a year, for conventional purposes only. Vipassana divides, dissects, disintegrates and observes reality as it is. Then the attachment goes away. The khandhās remain, arising and passing, but they are mere aggregates, because upādāna is gone. This is the Dhamma of the khandhās.<br/><br/>

**_Yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya anissito ca viharati,<br/>
na ca kiñci loke upādiyati._**<br/><br/>

Then comes ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya also known in those days as samyak darshana, kevala darshana, samyak jñāna kevala jñāna—mere observation and mere understanding. Then anissito ca viharati: there is nothing to depend on because there is no attachment; there is nothing to grasp.<br/><br/>

##### Āyatanapabbaṃ

**_—The Sense Spheres_**<br/><br/>

**_dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati chasu ajjhattikabāhiresu āyatanesu._**<br/><br/>

The āyatanas are the six sense spheres or doors: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. All six are inside (ajjhattika) because they are on or inside the body. Their objects are outside (bāhiresu): for the eyes, a vision, colour, shape, or light; for the ears, sound; for the nose, smell; for the tongue, taste; for the body, something tangible; for the mind, a thought, emotion, fantasy or dream. Although called external, they become objects only when in contact with the internal āyatanas, on the framework of the body. For someone blind from birth there is no world of colour, light, shape or form and no way of understanding that world. Six internal āyatanas and six external āyatanas, make twelve in all, and the bāhiresu āyatana only actually exist for us when each is in contact with its respective sense door.<br/><br/>

How is the work done with the six internal and external sense spheres?<br/><br/>

**_cakkhuṃ ca pajānāti, rūpe ca pajānāti,<br/>
yañca tadubhayaṃ paṭicca uppajjati saṃyojanaṃ tañca pajānāti…_**<br/><br/>

The truth of cakkhu (the eye sense door) and its object, rūpa (the shape or form) is realised: pajānāti. Yañca tadubhayaṃ paṭicca, with the base of these two, because of their contact, uppajjati saṃyojanaṃ—a bondage arises.<br/><br/>

**_…yathā ca anuppannassa saṃyojanassa uppādo hoti tañca pajānāti…_**<br/><br/>

The meditator works with this bondage that has now arisen: saṃyojanassa uppādo hoti tañca pajānāti. The reality is that with every contact there is vibration, phassa-paccayā vedanā.<br/><br/>

Saññā evaluates: female, male; beautiful, ugly; pleasant, unpleasant. With this evaluation the sensations become pleasant or unpleasant, and immediately saṅkhāra, the reacting part of the mind, starts generating craving or aversion. Thus this whole process of bondage starts and multiplies.<br/><br/>

The work with the six sense doors is within the boundary of mind and matter. It is a matter of analysing and continually understanding how everything happens. If you are ignorant you constantly tie new knots and multiply bondage after bondage. When you don’t react, as you experience and observe the bondage in wisdom, it weakens. The habit pattern of reaction starts changing. The old bondages can come on the surface: yathā ca anuppannassa saṃyojanassa uppādo hoti tañca pajānāti. You observe the arising (uppāda) of the bondage which had not previously come up (anuppanna).<br/><br/>

**_…yathā ca uppannassa saṃyojanassa pahānaṃ hoti tañca pajānāti,<br/>
yathā ca pahīnassa saṃyojanassa āyatiṃanuppādo hoti tañca pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

As you observe, the bondages get eradicated (pahānaṃ)one after the other: yathā ca uppannassa samyojannassa pahānaṃ hoti tañca pajānāti. When they have all come to the surface and passed away they do not again arise (āyatiṃ anuppādo). The stage beyond bondage, of total liberation, is reached.<br/><br/>

There are three types of eradication. Even when you just observe sīla, because at the surface level of the mind you are not over-reacting with craving or aversion, there is momentary eradication of your bondage. When you go deeper with samādhi, there is more eradication: the roots are shaken. Then when you practise Vipassana these roots are eradicated at the deepest level of the mind—pahānaṃ. For example, a thirsty person comes to drink at a pond with a surface covered by poisonous weeds. The weeds are pushed aside by hand from a small area, for temporary access; but afterwards they again cover this small area. This is momentary eradication. This is sīla. For better access, four poles with nets between are set up to hold back the weeds. This is samādhi which, as it goes deeper, clears a larger area, but leaves the roots.<br/><br/>

Paññā removes all the weeds, so that not a particle remains. This is real pahāna at the root level, which is what is meant here: yathā ca pahīnassa saṃyojanassa āyatiṃ anuppādo hoti tañca pajānāti. Total eradication of the bondages is realised; they cannot again arise (anuppādo). This is the stage of the arahant, of total liberation.<br/><br/>

**_Sotañca pajānāti, sadde ca pajānāti,<br/>
yañca tadubhayaṃ paṭicca uppajjati saṃyojanaṃ tañca pajānāti…_**<br/><br/>

Similarly the ear, the sound, and the bondage that arises because of them is observed.<br/><br/>

**_…yathā ca anuppannassa saṃyojanassa uppādo hoti tañca pajānāti,<br/>
yathā ca uppannassa saṃyojanassa pahānaṃhoti tañca pajānāti,<br/>
yathā ca pahīnassa saṃyojanassa āyatiṃ anuppādo hoti tañca pajānāti._**<br/><br/>

As equanimity develops, such bondages which had never previously come to the surface do so and are eradicated. This also is observed.<br/><br/>

**_Ghānañca pajānāti, gandhe ca pajānāti…<br/>
Jivhañca pajānāti, rase ca pajānāti…<br/>
Kāyañca pajānāti, phoṭṭhabbe ca pajānāti…<br/>
Manañca pajānāti, dhamme ca pajānāti…āyatiṃ anuppādo hoti tañca pajānāti..._**<br/><br/>

Similarly the reality of nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and anything tangible, and mind and contents (dhamme) are observed (pajānāti). In each case the bondages arise, are eradicated, and do not come again. In each case the stage of an arahant is not merely accepted philosophically, but is experienced, witnessed: pajānāti.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati…‘atthi dhammā’ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati._**<br/><br/>

The same process follows. "This is dhamma." All the six sense doors and their objects are mere dhamma, with no "I," "mine," "he," or "she," no individual there. Dividing, dissecting, disintegrating and dissolving, analysing each sense door separately, the individual becomes just a mass, a process, an interaction of all of the āyatanas combined. With mere intellectual understanding, ignorance will prevent the witnessing of this dhamma, this process, and the escape from this bondage.<br/><br/>

The practice leads through the same stations to the final goal.<br/><br/>

##### Bojjhaṅgapabbaṃ

**_—The Factors of Enlightenment_**<br/><br/>

**_dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati sattasu bojjhaṅgesu_**<br/><br/>

The bojjhaṅgas are the seven factors of enlightenment or qualities to be developed to reach the final goal.<br/><br/>

The mind by itself is very pure: viññāṇa is very pure, but because of past saṅkhāras, conditioned saññā always gives a wrong evaluation, and when the sensation arises, saṅkhāra after saṅkhāra is again created. Because of this entire process, the mind loses its own nature of purity and becomes very agitated. Bojjhaṅgas restore this purity: when they are observed as a reality, they increase to become perfect and when each is perfect, enlightenment is perfect. This is the whole process of Vipassana.<br/><br/>

The first bojjhaṅga is sati, awareness. Without it, further steps on the path cannot be taken. Sati, objective observation of reality, is the most important factor because it must be continuously present from moment to moment with every other factor.<br/><br/>

Dhamma-vicaya is second. The word caya or cayana means "to integrate." Apparent, consolidated, integrated, illusionary truth creates so much delusion and confusion: every decision and action goes wrong. Vicaya or vicayana means to divide, dissect, disintegrate, separate, as Vipassana intends you to do. Initially dhamma-vicaya is intellectual. The body is analysed as just four elements, with no "I" about it. The mind is just the four aggregates. The six sense doors, their respective objects, the contact and process of multiplication are observed. The intellectual clarity gained gives guidance to start the actual practice of Vipassana and study the truth at the actual level.<br/><br/>

The third bojjhaṅga is viriya (effort) as in sammā-vāyāmo in the Noble Eightfold Path. Great effort is required, but the effort is not to react, to let things just happen. Even if you have been victorious in a thousand battles against a thousand warriors, this inner battle of non-reaction is more difficult because the old habit is to do something, to react. Don’t fight Ānanda’s battle—"I must become an arahant," "I must" eradicate my impurities—if you do, the mind becomes unbalanced. Another extreme is not to work, not to observe at all, and just let things happen. Let things happen, but also know the reality as it is. Some slight degree of tension is necessary: either too much, or none at all, doesn’t work. For example, some pressure is necessary to drill a hole in a precious gem, but too much pressure will break it. It is a middle path.<br/><br/>

As you keep practising with sati, dhamma-vicaya, and viriya, the impurities go away, and pīti comes and grows: pleasant sensation in the body, rapture, and bliss. You have to be careful. If you develop attachment to this free flow of subtle vibrations throughout the body, if you look for it and cling to it, it is no longer a bojjhaṅga. If the understanding of anicca remains—that this is still the field of mind and matter, of arising and passing—then the impurity goes away, and pīti develops and becomes a factor of enlightenment.<br/><br/>

As wave after wave of this pleasant sensation comes and is observed, the important stage of passaddhi comes: deep tranquillity and calmness. Now even a slight sound is a great disturbance. Even the breath which becomes like a fine thread, making a subtle U-turn at the entrance of the nostrils, is a disturbance. The mind is so peaceful, quiet, tranquil. Again a danger comes: the false impression that this deep peace, never experienced before, is liberation. Just as pīti, bliss, may become a bondage if not used properly, in the same way this passaddhi also may become a bondage. It is only a midway resthouse: the final goal is still far away. You can check that the six sense doors are still functioning: open your eyes, or listen. You are still in the field of arising and passing. You have not transcended the field of mind and matter.<br/><br/>

Although difficult to grasp at this high stage, a subtle oscillation remains, and this sensation is called adukkhaṃasukhaṃ. In pīti it was pleasant; now it is just peaceful, and the danger is that anicca is not experienced. Detachment from craving towards pleasant sensation or aversion towards unpleasant sensation is much easier than detachment from this feeling of peace. Be very attentive: with a very sharp mind, feel the subtle oscillation, check the six sense doors, and keep understanding that this experience is anicca.<br/><br/>

There is often a question about neutral sensation. The Buddha did not mean the initial, surface sensation which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. That is totally different. It involves craving and aversion because people get bored with it, lose interest, and want something else. Their experience has become stale. They want something more or new, something they don’t have. This is their old habit pattern.<br/><br/>

Different people from different sects, communities, countries, religions, beliefs, and dogmas come to this Ganges of Vipassana to quench their thirst, to end ignorance and misery. Even when the mind-matter structure is accepted as arising and passing, and essenceless, because of their background this deep, neutral sensation gives an illusion of eternity, and so can become a bondage. To someone with a traditional belief in eternal soul, passaddhi seems to be this. To another with a belief in an eternal creator living inside us, it seems to be the unchanging creator. This is a dangerous illusion. Thoroughly examine this passaddhi, this deep, tranquil, calm experience. If you are aware of the very subtle oscillation, arising and passing, then it becomes a bojjhaṅga and gives you the strength to move further. Your experience grows.<br/><br/>

The next enlightenment factor is samādhi—concentration or absorption. There were different types of samādhis before the Buddha became Buddha, as there are today. When eight jhānas are attained, there is a danger of feeling that the goal is attained, but this is only lokiya samādhi, which life after life results in rotation from one plane of existence to another. Sammā-samādhi takes us out of all the planes and gives full liberation from the bondage of birth and death, and from every type of suffering. It is practised with sampajañña, the awareness of the mind-matter phenomenon and the realisation of its nature of arising and passing. The mind is concentrated on reality. Then it becomes lokuttara, beyond the planes. As the jhāna is attained, simultaneously the fruit of nibbāna is attained. With samādhi, one after the other, the meditator attains the fruit of sotāpanna, sakadāgāmī, anāgāmī, and arahant. Then samādhi becomes an enlightenment factor.<br/><br/>

Upekkhā—equanimity is the seventh factor of enlightenment. Like sati, it must be present from the beginning to the end, at every step. Whatever other factor is worked on, awareness and equanimity must always be there.<br/><br/>

A pure mind has all these factors. Impurities, as they are observed, come to the surface and get eradicated; but these enlightenment factors, as they are observed, one by one, come on the surface, develop, multiply and become totally fulfilled. This section explains how the final goal of full enlightenment is thus reached.<br/><br/>

**_santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ satisambojjhaṅgaṃ<br/>
‘atthi me ajjhattaṃ satisambojjhaṅgo’ti pajānāti,<br/>
asantaṃ vā ajjhattaṃsatisambojjhaṅgaṃ <br/>
‘natthi me ajjhattaṃ satisambojjhaṅgo’ ti pajānāti._**<br/><br/>

When the enlightenment factor of sati is present (santaṃ) the meditator understands (pajānāti)—‘Atthi me ajjhattaṃ…’ ("Now it is present in me.") When it is asantaṃ (not present) the meditator accepts this reality also—‘Natthi me ajjhattaṃ…’ ("Now it is not present in me.")<br/><br/>

**_…yathā ca anuppannassa satisambojjhaṅgassa uppādo hoti tañca pajānāti,<br/>
yathā ca uppannassa satisambojjhaṅgassa bhāvanāya pāripūrī hoti tañca pajānāti._**<br/><br/>

All the past accumulated enlightenment factors of sati now help. They now come on the surface (anuppannassa uppādo hoti) and the meditator understands (tañca pajānāti). Having repeatedly arisen (uppannassa) they are understood with wisdom and multiply till they become complete—totally and fully attained (bhāvanāya pāripūrī).<br/><br/>

**_Santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgaṃ…<br/>
bhāvanāya pāripūrī hoti tañca pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

Similarly dhamma-vicaya, analytical study of the truth, is understood as simply being present or absent. The past dhamma-vicaya, which had not arisen earlier, repeatedly arises from the depth of the mind and is observed: it develops to fulfilment and the final goal is reached. All this is understood.<br/><br/>

**_…vīriyasambojjhaṅgaṃ…<br/>
…pītisambojjhaṅgaṃ…<br/>
…passaddhisambojjhaṅgaṃ…<br/>
…samādhisambojjhaṅgaṃ…<br/>
Santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṃ… bhāvanāya pāripūrī hoti tañca pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

The enlightenment factors of viriya (effort), pīti (rapture, bliss, while feeling pleasant sensation in the body), passaddhi (tranquillity), samādhi (concentration) and upekkhā (equanimity) are understood in the same way and develop to completion.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati…<br/>
‘atthi dhammā’ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati._**<br/><br/>

Dhammas are observed inside, outside, and both inside and outside; arising, passing, and both arising and passing. The meditator realises, "These are dhammas" and the awareness gets established with this reality. There is no more grasping or clinging. Thus dhammānupassanā is practised.<br/><br/>

##### Questions And Answers<br/><br/>

**Q: Is directing our attention the only freedom we have, all other things being governed by Dhamma?**<br/><br/>

**A**: Everything is governed by Dhamma. Directing your attention is the only way to liberate yourself. You can do anything you wish, but if you react, Dhamma will bind you. If you just observe, Dhamma will certainly liberate you. This is the law of nature.<br/><br/>

**Q: Where is the dividing line between seriousness of practice and craving?**<br/><br/>

**A**: This is a good question. If you crave to work seriously, you are craving attainment of the result, or at least developing an attachment to working seriously. If you find yourself not working seriously and you then become depressed, there was craving. Just accept the fact that you were not working seriously and start again, knowing that you must work seriously. Then you keep progressing.<br/><br/>

**Q: Do neutral sensations come from neutral reactions, and do we hope to change this to mere observation**?<br/><br/>

**A**: Neutral sensations come because of ignorance. The ignorance goes when they are just observed as a changing phenomenon. A surface understanding of anicca, which is helpful, comes when after some time a very gross, solidified, unpleasant sensation goes. A deeper understanding, based on awareness of the subtle undercurrent of vibration, is that this sensation arises and passes every moment.<br/><br/>

**Q: When a meditator is carried away and rolls in thoughts of sense desire for some time before observation, is he multiplying the saṅkhāras to a worse state rather than purifying**?<br/><br/>

**A**: Previously the process of multiplication was continuous. Now your few moments of observation will turn into a few seconds, a few minutes, a few hours, which go to your credit. Practising Vipassana, you understand that every time you roll in sense desires, you multiply your misery, and as much as you observe you are coming out of it.<br/><br/>

**Q: The Buddha’s teaching seems to imply a sweeping movement of the attention related to the breath. What then is the origin and importance of working part by part in this practice**?<br/><br/>

**A**: When the Buddha says sabba-kāya-paṭisaṃvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, "sikkhati" means "learns." Elsewhere pajānāti ("he understands properly") is used. You have to learn to sweep the whole body with one breath, and this learning is—observing part by part, allowing its solidity to dissolve, until the whole body is dissolved and you can sweep the entire mass. Then again you go part by part because even though the whole body seems opened up, there might be small unknown areas. You learn (sikkhati) to reach the stage of bhaṅga-ñāṇa.<br/><br/>

**Q: The Sutta outlines four observations and numerous practices, yet you teach only respiration and sensation on the body. There is no ranking of practices by order of importance. Why not also teach all practices such as walking meditation and noting ideas**?<br/><br/>

**A**: There are different traditions, and the Buddha, an enlightened person, also gave different initial objects to different people according to their background, capacity and inclination. However, as they proceeded, the stations were the same.<br/><br/>

This living tradition comes from the initial practice of respiration, from which the meditator goes on to experience sensation, and thus arising and passing. Awareness of respiration and sensation together will lead to the final goal. It is not prohibited to try something else, but if you are progressing here, trying elsewhere just out of curiosity will waste your time. If you already feel sensation everywhere and now somewhere else you try observing walking—each foot moving up and down, but without sensation—your faculty of feeling sensation at a subtle level will get blunted. Reverting again to this technique you won’t be able to feel sensations at that depth. Of course there are people with very gross, rough types of mind for whom subtle respiration is very difficult, and walking may suit them better.<br/><br/>

It is also difficult to feel subtle breath in a small area. If you are already feeling it clearly and then you try to feel it with your hand on the stomach—which is such a crude technique—you are regressing. The Buddha intends you to move from oḷāriko to sukhuma—from the gross to the subtle. If at a certain stage something gross arises from the depths, it can’t be helped; but just out of curiosity you cannot afford to start intentionally working with a gross object, such as the first sentences of another technique, forgetting all about the subtle reality of the station you had already reached. If another technique suits you better, stick to it and reach the final goal: but time is essential. Don’t waste your precious life running here and there.<br/><br/>

**Q: "I" is not**.<br/><br/>

**A**: Yes—"I" is not!<br/><br/>

**Q: What is it then that needs enlightening?**<br/>

**A**: Ignorance needs enlightening, bondage needs liberation. Nothing else.<br/><br/>

**Q: How do you define a mind of compassion? Can we use compassion with awareness when dealing with our own suffering?**<br/>

A: When compassion is in your mind, accept your mind as a mind of compassion. Certainly be kind to yourself, love yourself, be the first object of your own compassion. Every time you generate saṅkhāras, even craving and aversion towards someone else, you cruelly inflict so much misery on yourself. Your anger will not harm a good Vipassana meditator—it may or may not harm others—but you yourself are harmed and become miserable. Avoid it. Be kind and compassionate to yourself.<br/><br/>

**Q: Is it true that the interpretation of vedanā most distinguishes our form of Vipassana from others in the Buddhist tradition? And how do the others define vedanā, if not as physical sensations?**<br/><br/>

**A**: Yes. Other traditions take vedanā only as feelings of the mind. We don’t condemn others and it is true that vedanā is one of the four aggregates of the mind. We have to explain rather than just translate because some words used by the Buddha had already been explained previously by him. For instance, sampajañña had been explained as the feeling of sensations arising and passing. Also, many words today are either lost or carry totally different meanings, so that we have to go to the Tipiṭaka to find the Buddha’s original definition of them. The Buddha had explained that sukha and dukkha vedanā referred to the body, and he used somanassa and domanassa to refer to the mind. In vedanānupassanā he doesn’t use somanassa and domanassa, but sukha and dukkha vedanā, so we have to work with sensations on the body.<br/><br/>

Whatever you have understood intellectually and whatever you have experienced, make use of it. Make use of Dhamma not only on this course but in daily life. Reaction is always full of negativity. Live the life of Dhamma. Whatever happens outside, observe the reality of sensations inside and remain equanimous, then all your decisions and all your actions will be healthy—not reactions, but positive actions, good for you and good for others.<br/><br/>

**May all of you be able to lead a life good for both yourself and others. May you all enjoy the best fruits of Dhamma: peace, harmony, happiness**.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy.**
