The fifth day of the Satipaṭṭhāna course is over. We have covered kāyānupassanā.<br/><br/>

Kāyānupassanā is not complete without vedanānupassanā, because anupassanā means to continuously experience the truth, which means to feel the body. Actually vedanā is central in all four satipaṭṭhānas. Mind and mental contents also have to be felt. Without feeling, the practice is just an intellectual game. This tradition emphasises vedanā because it gives us a tangible understanding of anicca, of arising and passing, samudaya, vaya. This understanding at the level of vedanā is absolutely essential because without it there is no sampajañña. Without sampajañña there is no paññā. Without paññā there is no Vipassana. Without Vipassana there is no Satipaṭṭhāna, and no liberation.<br/><br/>

Deep samādhi can be gained using any object of concentration. For instance the breath coming and going, as in the first paragraph of the Ānāpāna section, can be used to gain the deep absorption of the first jhāna, then the deeper absorption of the second jhāna and then the third and fourth jhānas. It is quite possible that along with the awareness of respiration, sensation may also be felt; but without the appreciation of arising and passing, it is not Vipassana. Then from the fifth to the eighth jhānas the body is forgotten. These work with the mind only, and imagination is used.<br/><br/>

Before his enlightenment, the Buddha had already learnt the seventh and eighth jhānas from Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, and certainly attained much purification. However he still found deep-rooted impurities inside, which he called anusaya kilesa. Saya means sleeping. Anu indicates that they follow with the mind from birth to birth. Like dormant volcanoes they can erupt at any time, and one of them always arises at the time of death. The others just follow on to the next life. For this reason, though he had perfected the eight jhānas, he did not accept himself as liberated.<br/><br/>

Bodily torture also produced no result. He continued to investigate. From respiration he started observing sensation, and from this he gained the understanding of arising and passing. The key to liberation was found. The jhānas which he had practised previously now had Vipassana, sampajañña, added to them. Previously they were called lokiya jhānas because they still resulted in new birth and so rotation in the loka, the planes of the universe. Now they were called lokuttara jhānas, because with the experience of arising and passing they gave the fruit of nibbāna, beyond the loka. This is the Buddha’s contribution to humankind, and it is attained with vedanā, which is why vedanā is so important for us.<br/><br/>

##### Vedanānupassanā

**_—Observation of Sensations_**<br/><br/>

**_vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati_**<br/><br/>

How are sensations observed in sensations? No imagination is involved. It is not as if the meditator is outside and thus examining his or her feelings. No one is standing outside. You must have direct experience. The same applies to kāya, and later to citta and dhammā. The observation must be without any separation of observer and observed, or the imagination of any outside examiner.<br/><br/>

**_…sukhaṃ vā vedanaṃ vedayamāno <br/>
‘sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti…_**<br/><br/>

Experiencing a pleasant sensation (sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno) the meditator understands this as the experience of a pleasant sensation.<br/><br/>

**_…dukkhaṃ vā vedanaṃ vedayamāno <br/>
‘dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti; <br/>
adukkhamasukhaṃ vā vedanaṃvedayamāno<br/>
‘adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

The same applies to unpleasant (dukkha vedanā) sensation, such as pain; and neutral sensation (adukkhamasukha vedanā), which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. The words sukha and dukkha refer to bodily feelings. For pleasant or unpleasant mental feelings, the Buddha used somanassa and domanassa. Sukha and dukkha vedanā therefore refer to sensation on the body. Body by itself cannot feel them, and they are felt by a part of the mind; nevertheless the body is the base.<br/><br/>

**_Sāmisaṃ vā sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno<br/>
‘sāmisaṃ sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti;<br/>
nirāmisaṃ vā sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno<br/>
‘nirāmisaṃ sukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti._**<br/><br/>

A pleasant sensation is understood properly as being with craving or attachment (sāmisa) or without craving or attachment (nirāmisa). In today’s India nirāmisa means vegetarian and sāmisa means non-vegetarian food. The meaning here is pure or impure. A pleasant sensation arising as result of proper Vipassana meditation, if it is observed without craving or attachment, leads to purity. The same pleasant sensation, perhaps encountered through involvement in some sensual pleasure, if it is reacted to with craving and attachment, with an attempt to increase it, is unwholesome and leads to impurity. It leads to rotation in misery. In this sense, a pleasant sensation may be pure or impure.<br/><br/>

A sāmisa sensation is just to be observed, so that the reaction weakens and stops. A nirāmisa sensation, towards which there is equanimity, and no reaction, is also just observed. Then naturally according to the law, this faculty of objective observation increases. You do nothing. Pajānāti is mere observation, based in wisdom.<br/><br/>

**_Sāmisaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ… nirāmisaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ… pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

**_Sāmisaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ… <br/>
nirāmisaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayamāno<br/>
‘nirāmisaṃadukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ vedayāmī’ti pajānāti._**<br/><br/>

Similarly whether the unpleasant (dukkha) sensation experienced is pure or impure depends on whether there is a reaction to it. It also is just observed, understood and accepted as it is. The neutral (adukkhamasukha) sensation is understood in the same way.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati,<br/>
bahiddhā vā vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati,<br/>
ajjhattabahiddhā vā vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati_**.<br/><br/>

As in every section, similar stations now follow. The sensations are felt inside and on the surface of the body, and then simultaneously throughout the entire physical structure.<br/><br/>

Another tradition interprets ajjhattaṃ as the feeling on one’s own body, bahiddhā as the feeling on someone else’s body, and ajjhatta-bahiddhā as switching between the two. As before, our tradition does not accept this. The meditator is working alone, whether in the forest, under a tree, or in a cell. It is argued that when begging for food the monk encounters others and has this opportunity to feel their breath or sensations. However the eyes of serious meditators are downcast (okkhitta-cakkhu) and at most they might see someone else’s legs as they walk: so this interpretation seems illogical. Of course, at a very high stage of observation the meditator becomes very sensitive to the sensations of others also, and to the vibrations of the surrounding atmosphere and of animate and inanimate objects. Possibly it could be understood in this way.<br/><br/>

Otherwise to practise on someone else’s breath or sensations is unworkable. It is better
therefore to take ajjhattaṃ as "inside" and bahiddhā as "on the surface of one’s own body."<br/><br/>

**_…samudayadhammānupassī… vayadhammānupassī… samudayavayadhammānupassī vā vedanāsu viharati…_**<br/><br/>

This and the following stations, which occur in every section, are very important. The meditator has to pass through them. The arising of vedanā, the passing of vedanā, and the arising and instant passing of vedanā are felt.<br/><br/>

**_…‘atthi vedanā’ti vā panassa sati paccupaṭṭhitā hoti_**.<br/><br/>

In kāyānupassanā the stage of ‘atthi kāyo’ ti came when the body became merely a mass of subatomic particles, with no valuation or judgement: saññā no longer recognised it as human or animal, male or female, beautiful or ugly. It became just body as body, beyond differentiation. Similarly sensations, vedanā, are now seen just as sensations, vedanā, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. There is no judgement, no evaluation, no saññā. The awareness now established is of sensations as just sensations. Then the same stations follow to the final goal.<br/><br/>

**_Yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya anissito ca viharati,<br/>
na ca kiñci loke upādiyati_**.<br/><br/>

The role of vedanā was the Buddha’s great discovery for humanity. It is the important junction from which two roads start: either dukkha-samudaya-gāminī paṭipadā, the road in which misery is continuously generated, or dukkha-nirodha-gāminī paṭipadā, the road in which misery becomes totally eradicated. He discovered that every reaction, every saṅkhāra can be generated only with the feeling of sensation—pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. At the deepest level the mind constantly reacts to vedanā throughout the body, in every particle, all the time, wherever there is life. Unless sensations, vedanā, are experienced, any freedom from craving or aversion is only at the surface of the mind. It is an illusion of non-reaction because it is only in relation to outside objects: to the outside world of sound, vision, smell, touch-feeling or taste. What is missed is the reality of your reaction because every contact of an object with a sense door is bound to produce a sensation on the body, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. This is missed.<br/><br/>

You must go to that depth where you feel sensations and yet do not react. Only when you are aware of sensations and equanimous towards them can the habit pattern of the mind be changed at the deepest level. Deep-rooted saṅkhāras like lines drawn on rock with chisel and hammer—the anusaya kilesa—can then come up and pass away. Otherwise the process of multiplication continues. Therefore vedanā plays such an important role in Satipaṭṭhāna.<br/><br/>

##### Cittānupassanā

**_—Observation of Mind_**<br/><br/>

**_citte cittānupassī viharati_**<br/><br/>

How does a meditator practise observation of mind in mind?<br/><br/>

"In mind" (citte) means by direct experience, as "in body" and "in sensations." To avoid any imagination about the mind something must happen in it, because as something happens and then passes away, it can be felt as sensation.<br/><br/>

sarāgaṃ vā cittaṃ ‘sarāgaṃ cittaṃ’ti pajānāti, vītarāgaṃ vā cittaṃ ‘vītarāgaṃ cittaṃ’ti pajānāti.<br/><br/>

Sarāgaṃ means with craving, sa-rāga. If craving has arisen in the mind, this is just observed. When it passes away, and the mind is free of it (vīta-rāgaṃ) this is just observed: the craving arose and passed away.<br/><br/>

**_sadosaṃ vā cittaṃ… vītadosaṃ vā cittaṃ <br/>
‘vitadosaṃ cittaṃ’ti pajānāti_**,<br/><br/>

**_samohaṃ vā cittaṃ ‘samohaṃ cittaṃ’ ti pajānāti,<br/>
vītamohaṃ vā cittaṃ ‘vītamohaṃ cittaṃ’ti pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

The reality of a mind with or without aversion (dosa) is observed and when the aversion passes away the mind is free of it. Similarly moha (illusion, delusion, confusion, ignorance) is observed: when it has gone the mind is free of it.<br/><br/>

**_Saṅkhittaṃ vā cittaṃ... vikkhittaṃ vā cittaṃ…<br/>
mahaggataṃ vā cittaṃ… amahaggataṃ vā cittaṃ…<br/>
sa-uttaraṃ vā cittaṃ… anuttaraṃ vā cittaṃ…<br/>
samāhitaṃ vā cittaṃ… asamāhitaṃ vā cittaṃ…<br/>
vimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ… avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ ‘avimuttaṃ cittaṃ’ti pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

Whether the mind is collected and concentrated (saṅkhitta) or vikkhitta (scattered)—this is just observed and accepted. In deeper jhānas when the mind is expanded, using imagination, to a limitless area, it is called mahaggata, big. Whether or not it is mahaggata—this is just observed. Sa-uttara means there are higher minds, or scope for development. Anuttara is when there is nothing higher: mind has reached the highest stage. This also is observed. Whether the mind is deeply absorbed in samādhi (samāhita) or not is observed. Whether the mind is liberated (vimutta) or in bondage is also observed.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā… bahiddhā vā…ajjhattabahiddhā vā citte cittānupassī viharati_**.<br/><br/>

The same stations follow. Mind is observed inside and outside. Again, this tradition does not accept bahiddhā as the mind of someone else. At a high stage of purification the meditator does develop the psychic power to read the minds of others, but this is not a final station.<br/><br/>

Mind inside (ajjhattaṃ) is a mind experiencing something within the framework of the body. Mind is taken as outside when it experiences an object from outside: when it feels a sound coming into contact with the ear, a shape with the eye, a smell with the nose, a taste with the tongue, something tangible with the body, or a thought of something outside. However the whole process is still within the framework of the body. Mind itself always remains inside the body, even when its object is outside.<br/><br/>

Then arising and passing is experienced and the stage of ‘atthi cittaṃ’ ti is reached: it is just viññāṇa, just mind, not "I" or "my" mind. The awareness gets established in this. Then there is mere wisdom or understanding, mere observation. There is nothing to support or to grasp.<br/><br/>

**_‘atthi cittaṃ’ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati_**.<br/><br/>

A Vipassana meditator understands how, when there is mere awareness, only cognition (viññāṇa) functions. There is no process of multiplication of misery. Recall the words spoken to the old hermit who came all the way from near Bombay to Sāvatthi to meet the Buddha. These words were sufficient, in that the hermit had already practised eight jhānas: diṭṭhe diṭṭhamattaṃ bhavissati… "In seeing there is only seeing," nothing beyond it, because there is no evaluation or reaction. "There is just hearing as hearing, smelling as smelling, tasting as tasting, touching as touching, and …viññāte viññātamattaṃ …cognising as cognising." This high stage takes time. But it must be reached to experience nibbāna.<br/><br/>

The practice is to understand this process. All the sense doors are on the body, so the body is central. There is a contact with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body touch, or mind. Viññāṇa cognises that something has happened. Then saññā evaluates it as good or bad, and the sensation that results is pleasant or unpleasant. Saṅkhāra reacts, and bondage, misery starts. These other aggregates overpower viññāṇa. Saṅkhāra has become so strong and viññāṇa so weak. As a result, misery and bondage have become so strong. The practice is to weaken saṅkhāra and saññā, and to strengthen viññāṇa, until there is nothing else but mere understanding and awareness—yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya paṭissati-mattāya.<br/><br/>

The Buddha practised eight jhānas before his enlightenment. The name of the eighth jhāna is nevasaññā-nāsaññāyatana: in this jhāna, saññā cannot be said either to exist or not exist. Although it has become so feeble, it does still exist, so the Buddha did not yet call himself a liberated person. Using Vipassana he developed the lokuttara jhānas, leading to nibbāna, and introduced the "ninth jhāna," which he called saññā-vedayita-nirodha: where saññā and vedanā stop. So long as saññā functions, however feebly, it will produce a reaction, a saṅkhāra. Saññā must be totally eradicated to experience the stage of viññāṇa as viññāṇa.<br/><br/>

##### Dhammānupassanā

**_—Observation of Mental Contents_**<br/><br/>

**_dhammesu dhammānupassi viharati_**<br/><br/>

Just as kāyānupassanā is incomplete without vedanānupassanā, so cittānupassanā is incomplete without dhammānupassanā. For the mind and body be felt, something must arise on them; otherwise the practice is just imagination. Therefore citta can only be experienced when something arises and passes away, such as rāga, dosa, or moha.<br/><br/>

What mind contains is called dhamma.<br/><br/>

Many words used by the Buddha are difficult to translate, because they have no equivalents in other languages. Of these, dhamma is the most difficult. Its range of meaning is vast. Its root meaning is dhāretī’ti dhammo: that which is contained. It is what is contained in the mind.<br/><br/>

A further meaning became the nature or the characteristic of whatever arises in the mind:<br/><br/>

**_Attano sabhāvaṃ attano lakkhaṇaṃ dhāretī’ti dhammo_**.<br/><br/>

Dhamma means the self-nature, the self-characteristic that is contained.<br/><br/>

Sometimes in the languages of India today, it is said that the dhamma of fire is to burn. Burning is its characteristic, otherwise it is not fire. The dhamma of ice is to cool, or it is not ice. Similarly rāga (craving) contains its own dhamma or characteristic, which is to create agitation and misery. The dhamma of love and compassion is calmness, harmony and peace. So dhamma became the nature or the quality.<br/><br/>

After a few centuries the term dhamma, or nature, was divided into kusala (wholesome) and akusala (unwholesome), referring to its fruit. Impurities contained in the mind—such as anger, hatred, animosity, passion, fear, and ego, which give unwholesome fruit—were called akusala. Qualities which were to one’s credit and gave a better life—such as compassion, goodwill and selfless service—were called kusala. Thus in the old literature we find dhamma divided into "pure" and "impure."<br/><br/>

Slowly akusala became adhamma or pāpa, anti-Dhamma or sin, that which causes rotation in misery. Then Dhamma became used for anything wholesome, contained in a person, which leads to liberation.<br/><br/>

The meaning of dhamma continued to expand. As the result of a mental content is observed—say what happens as result of anger or compassion—the law of cause and effect, that is the law of nature, starts to be understood. Therefore dhamma can be whatever is contained in the mind, or the characteristic of that which is contained, or the law of nature—that is, the law of the universe.<br/><br/>

How does a meditator practise observation of the dhammas?<br/><br/>

---

##### Nīvaraṇapabbaṃ

**_—The Hindrances_**<br/><br/>

**_dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu nīvaraṇesu_**.

Nīvaraṇa means a "curtain" or "cover": that which prevents the reality from being seen. In the ten-day courses we refer to the nīvaraṇas as the five enemies: craving, aversion, drowsiness, agitation, and doubt. An example is given. At that time there were no mirrors, and people used to look at the reflection of their faces in a pot of clean water with a light. If the water is dirty, coloured, or agitated, you can’t see properly. Similarly, these nīvaraṇas are enemies to your progress on the path of observing reality because they colour or prevent you from seeing it.<br/><br/>

Again there is no imagination involved: dhamma is experienced in dhamma (dhammesu). Nor does this section involve any contemplation. How then are these hindrances observed?<br/><br/>

**_santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ kāmacchandaṃ ‘atthi me ajjhattaṃ kāmacchando’ti pajānāti_**,<br/>

**_asantaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ kāmacchandaṃ ‘natthi me ajjhattaṃ kāmacchando’ti pajānāti_**<br/><br/>

When a craving for sensual pleasures (kāmacchanda) is present inside, this is just accepted. There is just awareness of this fact. When it is not present, this is understood: just awareness of the reality as it is, from moment to moment.<br/><br/>

**_…yathā ca anuppannassa kāmacchandassa uppādo hoti tañca pajānāti, yathā ca uppannassa kāmacchandassa pahānaṃ hoti tañca pajānāti, yathā ca pahīnassa kāmacchandassa āyatiṃ anuppādo hoti tañca pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

Then those kāmacchandas which were lying deep inside and had not previously come to the surface (anuppanna) now do so (uppāda). This is also understood (pajānāti). Things arise and sooner or later pass away, samudayavaya; similarly this craving arises and passes away. As layers after layers arise and are observed, they are eradicated (pahāna). The layers that have been eradicated (pahīna) do not come back again (āyatiṃanuppādo). All this is just observed and understood (pajānāti).<br/><br/>

When all the accumulated craving has been eradicated, full liberation is reached. The mental habit of generating craving is gone, and no such saṅkhāra can be generated now.<br/><br/>

**_Santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ byāpādaṃ…<br/>
Santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ thinamiddhaṃ… <br/>
Santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ uddhaccakukkuccaṃ… <br/>
Santaṃ vā ajjhattaṃ vicikicchaṃ… tañca pajānāti_**.<br/><br/>

In the same way the meditator understands aversion (byāpādaṃ) to be present or absent. The whole process of Vipassana is described in these paragraphs. Whatever past aversion was lying low, like a dormant volcano deep inside, arises. This is also observed and eradicated. Unless the habit pattern is totally changed, saṅkhāras of aversion of the same type will start anew. When all are eradicated at the root level, nothing comes back. This is the final goal. It is impossible for an arahant to generate any new craving or aversion.<br/><br/>

Similarly thīna-midda (drowsiness of the mind and body), uddhacca-kukkucca (agitation) and vicikicchā (doubts, scepticism) are eradicated.<br/><br/>

It should be clear that every dhamma, anything that arises on the mind—even a slight thought—starts flowing with a sensation on the body: vedanā samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā. This law of nature was realised but not created by the Buddha. Whatever arises—anger, passion, or anything else—if the sensation is observed the meditator is working properly. Otherwise it is an intellectual game. Anger may have gone away at the surface level, but deep inside the sensation remains, and the mind continues to react with anger to this sensation without the meditator even knowing. Therefore, so far as this tradition is concerned, the sensation on the body cannot be missed. The words of the Buddha are so clear: sampajaññaṃ na riñcati. Every moment there must be awareness of sensation arising and passing.<br/><br/>

Whether you are practising any section of kāyānupassanā or vedanānupassanā, or cittānupassanā ordhammānupassanā, without the understanding of arising and passing of sensation, the accumulated impurities at the depth of the mind can be neither reached nor eradicated. The practice will just be a surface game.<br/><br/>

**The same stations follow**:<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati…‘atthi dhammā’ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati_**.<br/><br/>

**Observing inside and on the surface, and then arising and passing, the stage of ‘atthi dhammā’ ti, is reached: neither good nor bad, mine nor yours, just the law of nature, mere mental contents and their nature. The same stations follow until there is nothing to grasp**.<br/><br/>

When craving has arisen, you can’t take it out with aversion; otherwise you generate a new saṅkhāra of aversion. If you just accept that there is craving in the mind, then you are just observing, and the reaction, which is the nature of craving, is not being multiplied. It is weakened and becomes feeble. Any mental impurity is similarly observed. Even the practice of intellectually contemplating the body as repulsive, as in some opening paragraphs of kāyānupassanā, was given by the Buddha merely as a beginning to bring people on the right path. Once Vipassana starts, there is no aversion to this ugly body; it is just observed as it is with the wisdom of arising and passing—yathābhūta-ñāṇa-dassanaṃ. The ñāṇa, as in pajānāti, is just awareness with the understanding of anicca. Whatever arises—whether good or bad, pure or impure—there is mere observation, no attempt to retain or push it out. This is the proper path to the final goal.<br/><br/>

The path is long, but it starts with the first step. Don’t be disheartened if the final goal is far away. No effort is wasted on this path. Whatever effort you make gives you benefit. You have started on the right path to the final goal. Step by step, as you come nearer and nearer, you are bound to reach the final goal.<br/><br/>

May all of you keep walking on this path, step by step. Make use of the time and the facility. Understanding the direct words of the Buddha, make use of this wonderful technique. As much as possible try not to miss sampajañña in any situation. Excepting only the time of deep sleep, try to be aware with sampajañña in every physical activity, for your own good, benefit and liberation.<br/><br/>

**May you all be liberated from the bondages, the miseries**.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy.**<br/><br/>
