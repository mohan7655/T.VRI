The fourth day of the Satipaṭṭhāna course is over. We continue to recite the Sutta and to try to understand it in relation to the practice.<br/><br/>

We are still in kāyānupassanā. You can start with any of the four fields of kāyānupassanā, vedanānupassanā, cittānupassanā, or dhammānupassanā and with any section of kāyānupassanā, but as you proceed they intermingle. You have to reach certain important stations. You have to feel the body inside (ajjhattaṃ) and outside (bahiddhā), then both inside and outside (ajjhatta-bahiddhā). You have to experience arising and passing (samudaya-dhammānupassī viharati, vaya-dhammānupassī viharati) then both together, (samudaya-vaya-dhammānupassī viharati). You have to feel the entire body as a mass of vibrations arising and passing with great rapidity, in the stage of bhaṅga. Then you reach the stage of body as just body (‘atthi kāyo’ti), or sensations as just sensations, mind as just mind, or mental contents as just mental contents. There is no identification with it. Then there is the stage of mere awareness (paṭissati-mattāya) and mere understanding (ñāṇa-mattāya) without any evaluation or reaction.<br/><br/>

As you progress and get established in the practice, deep-rooted saṅkhāras come on the surface and are eradicated, provided you are vineyya loke abhijjhā-domanassaṃ, keeping away from craving and aversion towards mind and matter.<br/><br/>

In another discourse, the Buddha gave an illustration:<br/><br/>

**_Sabba kamma jahassa bhikkhuno, <br/>
dhunamānassa pure kataṃ rajaṃ._**<br/><br/>

**The meditator who does not make new kamma, <br/>
combs out old defilements as they arise.**<br/><br/>

When a meditator stops generating all kamma saṅkhāras, (that is, new actions or reactions), the old impurities—pure kataṃ rajaṃ—are combed out. Dhunamānassa means combing or carding cotton, separating every fibre, clearing out all the knots and dirt. This can happen at any stage, whenever you don’t generate a new saṅkhāra, but the very deep-rooted impurities only start coming up after bhaṅga. If you keep generating saṅkhāras, you keep multiplying your old stock. As long as you refrain from generating any new ones and remain equanimous, layers after layers of saṅkhāras are eradicated.<br/><br/>

Dhamma is very kind. Initially very crude saṅkhāras which would result in a very miserable, low order of new life, surface and get eradicated. You are relieved of them:<br/><br/>

**_uppajjitvā nirujjhanti, tesaṃ vūpasamo sukho_**

**having arisen, when they are extinguished, <br/>
their eradication brings happiness.**<br/><br/>

When all the saṅkhāras which would have taken you to a lower field of life are gone, the mind becomes perfectly balanced—fit to transcend the field of mind and matter and gain the first glimpse of nibbāna.<br/><br/>

This may be for a few moments, seconds or minutes, but on returning to the field of mind and matter the meditator’s behaviour pattern is totally changed. A saṅkhāra of the lower fields cannot now be generated. The clan is changed—gotrabhū. The anariyo becomes a sotāpanna, ariyo. Today the word ‘aryan’ has lost its meaning and is used for a certain race. In the Buddha’s day ariyo meant a noble person, one who had experienced nibbāna. Sotāpanna means one who has fallen into the stream, sota. Within seven lives at most such a person is bound to keep working to become an arahant. No power on earth can stop the process.<br/><br/>

The work continues in the same way: ātāpī sampajāno satimā. Further deep saṅkhāras come on the surface and pass away (uppajjitvā nirujjhanti) and a much deeper experience of nibbāna results. The meditator returns again to the field of arising and passing, a totally changed person, the stage of sakadāgāmī has been reached. Only one more life is possible in the sensual world. Then again the practice is ātāpī sampajāno satimā. Finer impurities, but ones which would still give lives of misery, are now eradicated by this equanimity, and the dip in nibbāna is again much deeper. The stage of anāgāmī is experienced. Now the only possible life is not in the sensual field, but in a very high Brāhmic plane. As the meditator continues, the finest saṅkhāras—which would give even one life of misery, because they are still within the circle of life and death—are eradicated, and the nibbāna of an arahant is experienced, total liberation. It can be in this very life or in future lives, but the practice is the same: ātāpī sampajāno satimā.<br/><br/>

Satimā is with awareness. Sampajāno is with wisdom, paññā, of arising and passing, direct experience of bodily sensations. Body alone cannot feel sensations and so mind is involved, but in the body is where they are felt. The Buddha gave an illustration: just as different kinds of winds arise in the sky—warm or cold, fast or slow, dirty or clean—so in the body different kinds of sensations arise and pass away.<br/><br/>

**In another discourse he said:**<br/><br/>

**_Yato ca bhikkhu ātāpī sampajaññaṃ na riñcati, <br/>
tato so vedanā sabbā parijānāti paṇḍito._**<br/><br/>

**Working ardently, without missing sampajaññaṃ, <br/>
a meditator experiences the entire field of vedanā and gains wisdom**.<br/><br/>

There are different kinds of vedanā whether the saṅkhāras are gross, finer or finest. Sampajaññaṃ day and night is thus the essence of the whole technique.<br/><br/>

**_So vedanā pariññāya diṭṭhe dhamme anāsavo, <br/>
kāyassa bhedā dhammaṭṭho saṅkhyaṃ nopeti vedagū_**.<br/><br/>

"**When the entire field of vedanā is transcended, Dhamma is understood. Such a person, without impurities (anāsavā) fully established in Dhamma (dhammaṭṭho) knows perfectly the entire field of sensations (vedagu) and does not after death (kāyassa bhedā) return to this field of sensations.**"<br/><br/>

This summarises the whole path to liberation. It is achieved with sampajañña, the wisdom of arising and passing, equanimity with sensations. Ātāpī, working hard, and satimā, when it is the awareness of the circus girl, will not alone liberate because sampajāñña is essential.<br/><br/>

It is not necessary to pass through every section of kāyānupassanā, because each is complete in itself. Only the starting point differs. You can start with any section and reach the same stations and ultimately the final goal. We start with Ānāpāna, and later switch to vedanānupassanā. However sampajañña is required at every stage. The second and third sections of kāyānupassanā are always necessary. We practise in the sitting posture, but at times during the day other postures are necessary. The second section covers all four postures of the body (sitting, standing, lying down, and walking) but it still involves ātāpī sampajāno satimā, whatever the position or posture. Then the third section involves sampajañña continuously in every physical activity. This is necessary because sampajañña must always be present. Thus the first three sections on bodily activities must continue throughout our practice, but not every section of kāyānupassanā.<br/><br/>

##### Paṭikūlamanasikārapabbaṃ

**_—Reflection on Repulsiveness_**<br/><br/>

Paṭikūla means "repulsive." Manasikāra means "reflection" or "contemplation." This will not in itself take you to the final goal. The Buddha teaches direct experience, not mere imagination or intellectualisation. However in some cases, when the mind is very dull or agitated, it cannot start with respiration, let alone with equanimity with the feeling of sensations. In most cases such people have strong attachment to the body and are engrossed in sexual pleasures, obsessed by the outer beauty of the body. They won’t try to understand, and cannot practise Dhamma, so this contemplation of repulsiveness is used to balance the mind at least slightly. They are asked just to start thinking in the proper way: what is this body?<br/><br/>

**_imameva kāyaṃ uddhaṃ pādatalā adho kesamatthhakā tacapariyantaṃ pūraṃ nānappakārassa asucino paccavekkhati…_**<br/><br/>

From the soles of the feet up and from the hairs of the head down the entire body covered by skin is reflected on or thought about (paccavekkhati) as impure (asucino) in different ways (nānappakārassa). It is all so ugly. It contains hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidney, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach and contents, faeces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid, and urine. This is its nature.<br/><br/>

This is just a beginning for those not in a position to observe reality inside. Impurity keeps overpowering them. Once they can think properly, they are fit to practise, either with respiration or directly with sensations. Of course, when the actual practice of Vipassana starts, there should be no aversion towards this ugly body. It is just observed as it is—yathābhūta. It is observed as body, with sensations arising and passing. The meditator is now on the path.<br/><br/>

The Buddha gives an example of a double-mouthed provision bag full of different seeds and grains, such as hill paddy, paddy, green gram, cowpeas, sesame and husked rice. Just as a man with good eyes can see all these different grains, so such things are seen in this body covered with skin. When divine eye is developed, at a much later stage, it becomes very easy to see the body. Every part—indeed, every particle of the body—is seen as if with open eyes.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati… <br/>
‘atthi kayo’ ti…na ca kiñci loke upādiyati_**.<br/><br/>

Then the process is the same. Although the starting point varies according to the background and mental capacity of the person, the ending stations are the same. The body is observed inside and out, ajjhatta-bahiddhā. The arising and passing away is observed: samudaya-vaya. Then ‘atthi kāyo’ ti, "This is body." The awareness gets established, and without any support in this world of mind and matter, there is nothing to grasp (na ca kiñci loke upādiyati) in the stage of full liberation.<br/><br/>

##### Dhātumanasikārapabbaṃ

**_—Reflections on Material Elements_**<br/><br/>

Dhātu means element. Again, for a certain type of person with strong attachment to the body and to sexual pleasures, thinking is involved at the beginning of the practice.<br/><br/>

**_imameva kāyaṃ yathāṭhitaṃ yathāpaṇihitaṃ dhātuso paccavekkhati: ‘atthi imasmiṃ kāye pathavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu vāyodhātū’ti_**.<br/><br/>

However the body is placed or disposed (kāyaṃ yathāṭhitaṃ yathāpaṇihitaṃ), the elements in it are just thought about (paccavekkhati): earth (pathavī), water (āpo), fire (tejo), and air (vāyo).<br/><br/>

The Buddha gives another example. Just as a butcher or his apprentice kills a cow, divides it into portions bit by bit, and sells it seated in the marketplace, so the body is understood as being just these four elements. It consists of: solidity—flesh, bones, and so forth; liquidity—blood, urine, and so forth; gases; and temperature. Just as "cow" is a conventional word for a composition of parts, so the body is nothing else but these four elements, none of which is "body." Thus people are brought to the point where the mind is at least slightly balanced.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati…<br/>
‘atthi kāyo’ti… na ca kiñci loke upādiyati_**.<br/><br/>

Then the same work starts, because mere thinking is not sufficient. The same stations have to be passed through. The stage is reached of ‘atthi kāyo’ti, "This is body," to which there was formerly so much attachment, and putting aside all attachments the meditator reaches the final goal.<br/><br/>

##### Navasivathikapabbaṃ

**_—Nine Cemetery Observations_**<br/><br/>

There were some people, then as now, with so much attachment to the body that even proper thinking was impossible. Therefore a cruder, grosser starting point was given: they were just taken to a cemetery. This was of the kind where the dead body is not burned or buried, but just thrown away to be eaten by birds, animals, and so forth. Unable to work with their attention inside themselves, they were just asked to start looking at a corpse. Then they could consider their own body in the same way:<br/><br/>

**_So imameva kāyaṃ upasaṃharati:<br/>
‘ayaṃ pi kho kāyo evaṃdhammo evaṃbhāvī evaṃanatīto’ti_**.<br/><br/>

They think (upasaṃharati) about their own body: "My body too is of the same nature, it will unavoidably become like this." There are nine cemetery contemplations:<br/><br/>
They view a corpse that is one-day, two-days, or three-days old, swollen, blue, and festering. They consider and understand that their body also has the same nature, and will ultimately die with the same result.<br/><br/>
Again they view a corpse thrown in a cemetery being eaten by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or different kinds of worms. Again they consider their own body in the same way.<br/><br/>
They view a corpse reduced to a skeleton with flesh or blood attached, held together by tendons. Then they consider their own body.<br/><br/>
They view a corpse reduced to a skeleton without any flesh but smeared with blood and held together by tendons.<br/><br/>
They view a corpse reduced to a skeleton without flesh or blood attached, held together by tendons.<br/><br/>
This time they view only disconnected bones scattered in all directions: the bone of a hand or foot, a knee-bone, thigh-bone, pelvis, spine, or skull.<br/><br/>
Now after a long time the bones are white, bleached.<br/> <br/>
They view bones that, after more than a year are just lying in a heap.<br/><br/>
They view bones that are rotting and breaking down into dust.<br/><br/>
Each time, after viewing, they reflect in the same way about their own body.<br/><br/>

It is necessary to begin with just viewing in this way because Vipassana—to observe and experience the true nature of reality—is a delicate job. People living a coarse, gross life, involved in gross impurities, cannot do it. Special cases are therefore taken to a cemetery, just to see, to keep contemplating, and to understand what they see as the ultimate result for everyone. They are asked to start thinking. With this feeling of repulsiveness and now with understanding, the mind is slightly balanced: it can practise.<br/><br/>

**_Iti ajjhattaṃ vā kāye kāyānupassī viharati…<br/>
‘atthi kāyo’ti… na ca kiñci loke upādiyati._**<br/><br/>

Now they start working through the same stations. They reach the stage of ‘atthi kāyo’ ti, "This is body," to which there was so much attachment. Then they continue until all attachments are given up at the stage of full liberation.<br/><br/>

The path is the same in every section. Only the starting point differs. In every section you must feel arising and passing away, manifesting as sensation, which is the combination of mind and matter. First you feel it separately, then together when it arises and instantly passes away. Then everywhere the entire structure is dissolved, arising, passing, arising, passing. You just observe. In this way you develop your faculties of sati and sampajañña—the wisdom that develops equanimity.<br/><br/>

There can be a type of equanimity even without the understanding of anicca. It is achieved by repeatedly suggesting non-reaction and calmness to the mind. Many people develop this faculty and seem not to react or be upset by the vicissitudes of life. They are balanced, but only at the surface level. A deeper part of the mind keeps on reacting because it is in constant contact with bodily sensations at a depth they have not reached. Without sampajañña, the roots of the behaviour pattern of reaction—the saṅkhāras—remain.<br/><br/>

This is why the Buddha gave so much importance to vedanā. To put aside craving and aversion is a traditional teaching of the past. In India there were teachers before and after the Buddha, and teachers contemporary to the Buddha, who taught it, and whose disciples practised it. Yet it was only in relation to outside objects: that which was seen, heard, smelt, tasted, touched, or thought. The Buddha went deeper. Both the six sense doors and their objects were called saḷāyatana. He discovered that the contact between the two inevitably results in sensation, and that craving or aversion arises only after the sensation arises.<br/><br/>

**_Saḷāyatana paccayā phasso,
phassa paccayā vedanā,
vedanā paccayā taṇhā:_**<br/><br/>

**Contact is because of the sense doors, sensation is because of contact, craving is because of sensation. This was his enlightenment**.<br/><br/>

The gap, the missing link, was vedanā. Without it people were dealing only with the sense objects, and their reactions to these objects. They could only rectify the intellect, the surface of the mind. Yet at the deepest level, following the contact, part of the mind evaluates this contact as good or bad. This evaluation gives a pleasant or unpleasant sensation. Then the reaction of craving or aversion starts. From his own experience the Buddha continued to teach equanimity towards sensations, to change the behaviour pattern of the mind at the deepest level, and to come out of bondage.<br/><br/>

This is what you have started practising. You are developing equanimity not merely to the sense objects—sound, vision, smell, taste, touch or thought—but to the sensations that you feel, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. Sampajañña has started with the understanding of the characteristic of arising and passing in bodily sensations. Having worked with Ānāpāna you easily experience sensations and you are developing equanimity with this understanding. You are practising the Buddha’s exact words. You work hard to remain satimā and sampajāno: ātāpī sampajāno satimā. This is the message of the whole Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.<br/><br/>

Make use of whatever time is left on this serious course. Reading and understanding the Sutta at the intellectual level will give much inspiration, guidance and confidence that you are doing what the Buddha intended: but intellectual understanding will not in itself liberate you. Make use of this Sutta and these evening discourses, but work. Work day and night, sampajaññaṃ na riñcati.<br/><br/>

In deep sleep you are helpless, but otherwise you should not miss sampajañña for a moment, whatever you are doing—eating, drinking, walking, or lying down. Of course, at this stage the mind still wanders and you forget. You start contemplating, imagining or thinking, but see how quickly you realise, and start again with sensations. Keep reminding yourself. Develop your wisdom, your enlightenment. You have to change the old habit pattern of running away from sensations; you must remain with the deeper reality of arising and passing, samudaya-vaya, anicca. Come out of the ignorance, the bondage. Make use of these wonderful days of your life to come out of all your miseries.<br/><br/>

**May you all enjoy real peace, real harmony, real happiness**.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy**.<br/><br/>
