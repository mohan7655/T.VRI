The second day of the Satipaṭṭhāna course is over. This evening we will start to go through the discourse to understand it in relation to the actual practice.<br/><br/>

The name of the discourse is Mahā-satipaṭṭhāna Sutta. Sutta means discourse. Mahā means great, and indeed there is another shorter discourse on Satipaṭṭhāna. This present discourse, however, covers more subjects in detail and is therefore called mahā.<br/><br/>

Sati means awareness. It is a very important faculty of Dhamma, as was discussed yesterday. It is one of the indriyas, the faculties to be developed. It is one of the balas, the forces, the strengths that must be developed to master Dhamma. It is one of the bojjhaṅgas, factors of enlightenment. Sammā-sati is part of the Noble Eightfold Path. Its literal meaning, as commonly used nowadays in India as smṛti, is "memory" or "remembrance". Vipassana involves no past memory, but you must always remember the object of meditation, which is the reality pertaining to mind and matter within the framework of the body. A better sense or understanding of sati is awareness, which is what it is; and awareness has to be of the reality of this moment as it is, of the present, not the past or future.<br/><br/>

Paṭṭhāna means getting established. Pa means extensively, which includes the element of paññā, wisdom. The awareness is not merely of the truth of mind and matter, but also of the nature of this truth: how it arises and passes; how it is a source of misery; how it is not "I," how it is substanceless. Direct experience is required. This is not mere intellectual understanding of an apparent truth. Awareness is established with wisdom, which is the understanding of the true nature of reality. Hence the name Mahā-Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.<br/><br/>

The discourse starts:<br/>

**_Evaṃ me sutaṃ._**<br/><br/>

**This was heard by me.**<br/><br/>

The words are not those of the Buddha. There is a history behind them, which Vipassana meditators should know.<br/><br/>

When the Buddha passed away at the ripened age of eighty, his students then present who were arahants, fully liberated, understood that everyone, a Buddha or an ordinary person, has to pass away. This is a law of nature. Others of his students who were not developed in Dhamma to this extent felt very sad, and some even cried. However one person, a monk, old in age but not wisdom, dissented. He felt very happy that the old man had passed away: now they were free of his clutches and could do what they liked. The Buddha’s own teaching after all was: Attā hi attano nātho—You are your own master. This incident reveals that elements had already entered the Saṅgha who were not interested in Dhamma. They had come for status, a comfortable life, and more alms and respect than they would receive otherwise.<br/><br/>

I feel very grateful to this monk. Why? When Mahākassapa, a wise, elderly monk, an arahant, fully liberated, and one of the chief disciples of the Buddha, heard this, he decided to preserve the actual teachings of the Buddha against future distortion by such elements. For forty-five years, day and night, the Buddha had taught Dhamma, hardly resting two or three hours at night, and even that not in ordinary sleep but with awareness and equanimity, with wisdom. He had given 82,000 discourses, and his leading arahant disciples had given another 2,000. This makes 84,000 in all. Mahākassapa thought that others, like this old monk, would in future misquote the teachings, substituting their own words and removing essential disciplines.<br/><br/>

Therefore he decided to call a conference of 500 elderly monks, arahants who were eyewitnesses to the Buddha’s teaching, to recite, compile and authenticate the actual words. Just a few could have done this, but to impress people and ensure acceptance he took 500 immediately after the Buddha’s death. Together they were to recite every word of the Buddha and give it the seal of authenticity.<br/><br/>

##### Ānanda

Ānanda was recommended to him as the 500th member of this gathering. Ānanda was born on the same day as Gotama the Buddha, was his cousin and had spent his childhood and youth with him. When the Buddha became enlightened, Ānanda was one of many family members who renounced the householder’s life and joined him. As the number of followers, and so the work, grew, the Buddha needed an assistant. Some came, but with various motives. The usual one was the hope for a private viewing of miracles, although in public the Buddha discouraged miracles. Another was to hear the answers to certain philosophical questions which he would never answer in public. Such people could not stay long, and they left.<br/><br/>

As the Buddha grew in age to fifty-five, the need for a stable personal assistant was accepted. Many senior monks were very eager to serve him so closely, but he was known to prefer Ānanda. Yet Ānanda remained silent. He actually asked the Buddha to agree to some terms. There were seven or eight, very healthy terms, and the Buddha accepted all of them. One was that if ever the Buddha gave a discourse at which Ānanda was not present, the Buddha must, on returning, repeat the discourse to him. Thus he heard every discourse for the last twenty-five years of the Buddha’s life. He had also heard them before that time. Ānanda had a wonderful faculty of memory due to his practice and past good qualities. If he heard something once, he could repeat it any time, word for word, like a computer or tape recorder today.<br/><br/>

Ānanda had served the Buddha for twenty-five years. He had been so close to him, was his great personal devotee, yet he was not an arahant, not fully liberated. He was only a sotāpanna, having reached the first stage of liberation after the initial experience of Nibbāna. Beyond that is the stage of sakadāgāmī, then anāgāmī, then arahant. You should understand from this that a Buddha cannot liberate anyone. Ānanda also knew Dhamma so well: thousands taught by him were arahants, yet he was continually serving the Buddha, without the time to progress himself.<br/><br/>

So Mahākassapa approached him, saying that now that the Buddha had passed away Ānanda had the time, and as a teacher he himself knew the technique so well. He asked him to work to become an arahant and join the gathering since he would be a great asset there. Ānanda gladly agreed; he would practise for a few days, become an arahant, and join them.<br/><br/>

He started working very vigorously, aiming to become an arahant. As a teacher he advised others not to develop ego, as it was a dangerous obstacle. Often the teacher when he practises forgets his own teaching, and this is what happened. His aim was—"I must become an arahant." He made no progress. Mahākassapa came and told him that the conference would start the following day, if necessary without him. If he was not an arahant they would take someone else.<br/><br/>

Again he tried the whole night— "I must become an arahant." The night passed away and the sun rose. Exhausted from his work, he decided to rest. He didn’t cry, he had that good quality. Now he was not aiming to be an arahant. He just accepted the fact that he was not an arahant, he was only a sotāpanna. Like a good meditator, remaining aware of sensations arising and passing, he took rest. His mind was now no longer in the future, but in the reality of the present moment. Before his head reached the pillow, he became an arahant.<br/><br/>

It is a middle path. With too much laxity you achieve nothing. With over-exertion the mind is unbalanced. Ānanda joined the conference.<br/><br/>

Now Ānanda was asked exactly what the Buddha had said, and all the teachings were compiled. Three divisions were made, called Tipiṭaka. Ti means three, piṭaka commonly means basket, though it also refers to scriptures. The first is Sutta-piṭaka, the public discourses.<br/><br/>

The second is Vinaya-piṭaka, the discourses to monks and nuns about discipline and sīla. For householders, five precepts, sīlas, are good enough, but for the monks and nuns there were over 200 sīlas, which is why the old monk dissented.<br/><br/>

The third is Abhidhamma-piṭaka, higher Dhamma, deeper truths about the laws of nature not easily understood by an ordinary person. It is an analytical study of the entire field of mind and matter with full detail of the reality pertaining to matter (rūpa), mind (citta), and the mental factors, the mental concomitants, the mental contents (cetasika). It fully explains how they interact and influence each other, how matter and mind stimulate the arising of both themselves and each other, and the interconnections, currents, and cross-currents deep inside. This all becomes clear not just by reading Abhidhamma, but only by a deep practice of Vipassana. Ānanda was asked to recite the Suttas and Abhidhamma, and another arahant, perfect in the discipline, Upāli, was asked to recite the Vinaya.<br/><br/>

This discourse comes in the Sutta-piṭaka.<br/><br/>

Ānanda starts Evaṃ me sutaṃ, "This was heard by me," because he had heard it directly from the Buddha. He also gives an explanation of the situation in which the Sutta was given. "At one time the Enlightened One was living (viharati) among the Kurūs at Kammāssadhammaṃ, a market town of the Kurū people." Viharati is used inIndia usually for very enlightened persons or those practising Dhamma. Kurū was then one of sixteen states in northern India at that time, now called Haryana, somewhere near Delhi and Punjab. The Buddha called the bhikkhus, that is the meditators present, and spoke.<br/><br/>

##### Kurū

The Buddha gave this discourse in Kurū for a reason. Not only the Buddha but others also had high regard for the people of Kurū. In another Indian tradition, the Bhagavad-Gītā starts with the words: Dharmakśhetre, Kurukśhetre, meaning in "the field of Dhamma, the field of Kurū." In another discourse the Buddha explains how the Kurūs lived a life of morality, observing sīla, from the king to the lowest subject. This was quite unusual, and what is now called sīla-dhamma had then been called Kurū-dhamma. Morality was their nature.<br/><br/>

At that time, in a past life of the Buddha, the then-bodhisatta was the ruler of Kurū. Kaliṅga, another state now called Orissa, was suffering from drought and famine year after year. It was then believed that such famines happened when people did not lead moral lives, because the ruler himself did not live a moral life. The elders of Kaliṅga advised the king to take five precepts, let all his people do the same, and observe them. It was also important that the precepts were taken from someone perfect in them. They recommended the ruler of Kurū, a perfect person, all of whose subjects lived a moral life.<br/><br/>

Two brahmin ambassadors were sent. They told the ruler the whole story and asked him to write the precepts down on a slate: on his behalf they would read it out, and people would start practising and so come out of their misery. The ruler of Kurū refused. Although he had been living a perfect life of sīla, he felt he had committed one slight mistake. He sent them to his elderly mother. She also said she had made one slight mistake. So they were sent to the chief queen; and similarly, successively to the king’s younger brother, to the prime minister, the revenue minister, the chief businessman, down even to the charioteer and the watchman at the gate. All said they had made a slight mistake.<br/><br/>

Yet these mistakes were so trivial. For example, the king had been demonstrating his skill in archery. An arrow fell in a pond, and did not float. Perhaps it pierced a fish. Whether it actually did is doubtful. The Kurū people were that careful.<br/><br/>

A base of sīla is essential. However, in the gap between one Buddha and another, other parts of Dhamma become lost, and this is what had happened. The Dhamma that a Buddha gives is complete and pure—kevalaparipuṇṇaṃ, kevalaparisuddhaṃ—with nothing to be added or taken out. As time passes important parts get lost. Paññā, the most difficult part, disappears first: only intellectual paññā remains. Then pure samādhi goes: imaginations remain, but the awareness of reality goes. Sīla remains, but when the other steps are lost, it is overemphasised and stretched to such extremes that the mind becomes unbalanced. The same thing happens in India today: people become too unbalanced to practise proper samādhi and paññā.<br/><br/>

The Buddha kept condemning sīla-vata-parāmāsa. Vata means a vow. Parāmāsa means attachment. Without proper samādhi or paññā, people take a vow, vata, and stretch just one sīla, thinking that it will liberate them. There is nothing wrong in sīla or vata, both are important. A vow not to take meals after midday helps your meditation, or to fast for a day keeps you healthy. But when it becomes stretched people fast for up to a month, just to prove their Dhamma, and the essence, the purpose gets lost.<br/><br/>

This was the situation in Kurū at that time. Their sīla was good, but had been stretched. Although that was wrong, still observing sīla is definitely much better than not observing it. What they lacked in Dhamma, could be gained by the technique. The Sutta therefore does not talk of sīla, because this strong background was already there. With such a good base, the people of Kurū would understand the details of this technique much better. Therefore the Buddha gave this Sutta in Kurū.<br/><br/>

Then he addressed the bhikkhus. In the ordinary language of India a bhikkhu means a monk, a recluse, but in all of the Buddha’s teachings a bhikkhu means anyone who is practising the teaching of Dhamma. Therefore it means a meditator, whether a householder—man or woman—or a monk or nun.<br/><br/>

##### The Opening Words

**_Ekāyano ayaṃ, bhikkhave, maggo_**<br/><br/>

**This is the one and only path.**<br/><br/>

**_Sattānaṃ visuddhiyā_**: to purify individuals. This at the mental level. Washing the body externally will not purify the mind. The results of this purification follow:<br/><br/>

**_Soka-paridevānaṃ samatikkamāya_**: transcending very deep sorrow, soka, and its manifestation in crying and lamentation, parideva. As you practise, it comes to the surface and observing, you pass beyond it, samatikkamāya.<br/><br/>

**_Dukkha-domanassānaṃ atthaṅgamāya_**. At a subtler level there is still unpleasant feeling in the mind, domanassa, and unpleasant sensation on the body, dukkha. These also are eradicated, atthaṅgamāya.<br/><br/>

**_ñāyassa adhigamāya_**. ñāya means truth. If you work with contemplation or imagination such results will not come. Only the surface of the mind is purified. The deepest misery can only be taken out when you observe the reality of mind and matter and their interconnection, from gross apparent truth to the subtlest ultimate truth. The truth experienced by the Buddha can only liberate the Buddha. A Buddha can only show the path, you have to walk on it. ñāyassa adhigamāya is the high road of liberation.<br/><br/>

**_Nibbānassa sacchikiriyāya_**. Nibbāna has to be experienced, realised, sacchikiriyāya, by the observation of truth. You have to reach the subtlest reality of mind and matter and then transcend it to witness something beyond. The entire field of mind and matter is that of anicca, arising and passing. At a gross level it arises, seems to stay for some time, and then passes away. At a subtler level, it passes with great rapidity. At the subtlest level there is merely oscillation. The ultimate truth beyond is where nothing arises or passes. It is beyond mind and matter, beyond the entire sensorium, the sensory field. The experience of nibbāna can be for a few moments, a few minutes, a few hours; it depends, but you come back a changed person. You can’t explain it. Of course people can give long intellectual explanations, but the sense organs stop functioning in nibbāna. They cannot be used to explain it. Thus the last of the six qualities of Dhamma is paccattaṃ veditabbo: it must be experienced directly and personally by each individual within him- or herself.<br/><br/>

**_Ekāyano maggo_**, "the one and only path," seems to be narrow-minded. Those who have not walked on the path, or have not walked on it very much, may feel uncomfortable. For those who have walked on it, it is clearly the one and only path. It is after all the universal law of nature. It is to be experienced and understood by everyone, from any religion or country. Fire will burn anyone’s hand. If you don’t like being burnt, you keep your hand away, whether you are a Buddhist or a Christian, an Australian or an American. The law of gravity exists with or without Newton. The law of relativity exists with or without Einstein. Similarly the law of nature remains whether or not there is a Buddha. It is cause and effect. Two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen make water. If either is missing on a planet, there will be no water. This is a law of nature. This is Dhamma. As you proceed—and work much deeper—you will understand this. If you don’t want misery, you have to remove the cause. Then the resulting misery is automatically removed.<br/><br/>

If you think that some supernatural power will liberate you in spite of all your impurities, it is just wishful thinking. It won’t happen. You have to work according to the law of nature. Your present deep habit pattern of reacting out of ignorance, as a result of which you keep experiencing misery, has to be changed.<br/><br/>

In this sense it is ekāyano maggo, and the Buddha now describes it further.<br/><br/>

…yadidaṃ cattāro satipaṭṭhānā: that is to say, the four satipaṭṭhānas. At this stage note how there are foursatipaṭṭhānas, or four ways of establishing awareness with wisdom. The first is:<br/>

**_Kāye kāyānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ._**<br/><br/>

Kāye kāyānupassī viharati: to live witnessing the reality of the body in the body. The practice is done ātāpī, very ardently, diligently, sampajāno, with the wisdom of arising and passing, and satimā, with awareness. No imagination is involved, rather direct full awareness, with wisdom. The truth pertaining to the body is observed, experienced within the body itself. This is done vineyya, keeping away from, abhijjhā-domanassaṃ, craving and aversion towards the loke, the mind-matter phenomena.<br/><br/>

**_Vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ_**.

The second is vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati: to live witnessing the truth of bodily sensations. Again there is no imagination. The truth is observed within the bodily sensations, by direct experience in the same way.<br/><br/>

**_Citte cittānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ_**.<br/><br/>

Similarly the third is citte cittānupassī viharati: witnessing the reality of mind within mind.<br/><br/>

**_Dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā, vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ._**<br/><br/>

The fourth is dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati: witnessing the reality of the mental contents, the law of nature, of mind and matter, within the law, within the mental contents. This is done in the same way.<br/><br/>

These four satipaṭṭhānas, observing the truth of body, or sensations, or mind, or contents of the mind, all have to be directly experienced. Intellectual understanding will give you inspiration and guidance as to how to practise, but only experience will give results. This is to be understood as we proceed.<br/><br/>

Now you are working with respiration, the reality of this moment, as it is, coming and going, deep or shallow. You try also to maintain awareness of the reality of sensation in this area of the body, below the nostrils above the upper lip, as it manifests from moment to moment. The object is this area of the body. Try to maintain the continuity of awareness day and night, except when you are in deep sleep. Most of the time the mind will wander. You will forget, you can’t help it, but as soon as you realise, bring the mind back. Don’t generate disappointment or depression. Just accept that the mind has wandered away, and start again. Work more seriously, more diligently now. Time is very short. You have come to a course with a very serious atmosphere, undisturbed by new students. Make use of it for your own good, benefit and liberation.<br/><br/>

**May you all enjoy real peace, harmony, happiness**.<br/><br/>

**May all beings be happy.**
