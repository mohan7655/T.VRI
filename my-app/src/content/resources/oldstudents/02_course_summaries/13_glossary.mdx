**Bramhana** literally, a pure person. Traditionally used to designate a member of the priestly caste in India. Such a person relies on a deity (Brahma) to "save" or liberate him; in this respect he differs from the samana. The Buddha described the true brahmana as one who has purified his mind, i.e., an arahat.<br/><br/>

**Buddha** enlightened person; one who has discovered the way to liberation, has practiced it, and has reached the goal by his own efforts. There are two types of Buddha:
(1) pacceka-buddha, "lone" or "silent" Buddha, who is unable to teach the way he has found to others; and
(2) samma-sambuddha, "full" or "perfect" Buddha, who is able to teach others.
Cakka wheel, Bhava-cakka,, wheel of continuing existence (i.e., process of suffering), equivalent to samsara. Dhamma-cakka, the wheel of Dhamma (i.e., the teaching or process of liberation). Bhava-cakka corresponds to the Chain of Conditioned Arising in its usual order.

At a later date the texts were translated into Sanskrit, which was exclusively a literary language.<br/><br/>

**Paññā** wisdom. The third of the three trainings by which the Noble Eightfold Path is practised (see magga). There are three kinds of wisdom: received wisdom (sutta-maya paññā), intellectual wisdom (cinta-maya paññā), and experiential wisdom (bhavana-maya paññā). Of these, only the last can totally purify the mind; it is cultivated by the practice ofvipassana-bhavana. Wisdom is one of the five mental strengths (see bala), the seven factors of enlightenment (see bojjhanga), and the ten pāramī.<br/><br/>

2. the truth of the origin of suffering (samudaya-sacca);
3. the truth of the cessation of suffering (nirodha-sacca);
4. the truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (magga-sacca);<br/><br/>

**Sadhu** well done; well said. An expression of agreement or approval.<br/><br/>

**Samādhi** concentration, control of one's own mind. The second of the three trainings by which the Noble Eightfold Path is practiced (see magga). When cultivated as an end in itself, it leads to the attainment of the states of mental absorption (jhana), but not to total liberation of the mind. The three types of samādhi are:
khanika samādhi, momentary concentration, concentration sustained from moment to moment;
upacara samādhi, "neighbourhood" concentration of a level approaching a state of absorption;
appana samādhi, attainment concentration, a state of mental absorption (jhana).<br/><br/>

**Samana** recluse, wanderer, mendicant. One who has left the life of a householder. While abrahamana relies on a deity to "save" or liberate him, a samana seeks liberation by his own efforts. Hence the term can be applied to a Buddha and to his followers who have adopted the monastic life, but it also includes recluses who are not followers of the Buddha. Samana Gotama ("Gotama the recluse") was the common form of address used for the Buddha by those who were not his followers.<br/><br/>

**Samatha** calm, tranquility. Samatha-bhavana, the development of calm; synonymous withsamadhi. See bhavana.<br/><br/>

**Sampajanna** understanding of the totality of the mind-matter phenomenon, i.e., insight into its impermanent nature at the level of sensation.<br/><br/>

**Samudaya-sacca**, the truth of the origin of suffering, second of the four Noble Truths.<br/><br/>

**Saṅkhāra** (mental) formation: volitional activity; mental reaction; mental conditioning. One of the five aggregates (khandha), as well as the second link in the Chain of Conditioned Arising (paticca samuppada). Saṅkhāra is the kamma, the action that gives future results and that thus is actually responsible for shaping one's future life. (Sanskrit samskara).<br/><br/>

**Saṅkhārupekkhā** literally, equanimity towards saṅkhāra. A stage in the practice of Vipassana, subsequent to the experience of bhanga, in which old impurities lying dormant in the unconscious rise to the surface level of the mind and manifest as physical sensations. By maintaining equanimity (upekkhā) towards these sensations, the meditator creates no newsankhara and allows the old ones to pass away. Thus, the process leads gradually to the eradication of all saṅkhāra.<br/><br/>

**sañña** (from samyutta-nana, conditioned knowledge) perception, recognition. One of the five aggregates (khandha). It is ordinarily conditioned by one's past saṅkhāra, and therefore conveys a coloured image of reality. In the practice of Vipassana, sañña is changed into paññā, the understanding of reality as it is. It becomes anicca-sañña, dukkha-sañña, anatta-sañña, asubha-sañña--that is, the perception of impermanence, suffering, egolessness, and of the illusory nature of physical beauty.
Sarana shelter, refuge, protection. Ti-sarana:Triple Refuge, i.e., refuge in Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha.<br/><br/>

**Sati** awareness. A constituent of the Noble Eightfold Path (see magga), as well as one of the file mental strengths (see bala) and the seven factors of enlightenment (see bojjhanga).Anapana-sati, awareness of respiration.<br/><br/>

**Satipaṭṭhāna**

the establishing of awareness. There are four interconnected aspects of satipaṭṭhāna:
observation of body (kāyānupassanā);
observation of sensations arising within the body (vedanānupassanā);
observation of mind (cittānupassanā);
observation of the contents of the mind (dhammanupassanā).

All four are included in the observation of sensations, since sensations are directly related to body as well as to mind. The Maha-satipaṭṭhāna Suttanta (Digha Nikaya, 22) is the main primary source in which the theoretical basis for the practice of vipassana-bhavana is explained.<br/><br/>

**Sato** aware. <br/><br/>**Sato sampajano**; aware with understanding of the impermanent nature of the mental-physical structure in its totality, by means of observation of sensations.<br/><br/>

**Siddhattha** literally, "one who has accomplished his task". The personal name of the historical Buddha (Sanskrit: Siddhartha).<br/><br/>

**sīla** morality; abstaining from physical and vocal actions that cause harm to oneself and others. The first of the three trainings by which the Noble Eightfold Path is practised (see magga). For a lay person, sīla is practiced in daily life by following the Five precepts.<br/><br/>

**Sotapanna** one who has reached the first state of saintliness, and has experienced nibbana. See ariya.<br/><br/>

##### T

**Tanha** literally, "thirst". Includes both craving and its reverse image of aversion. The Buddha identified tanha as the cause of suffering (samudaya-sacca) in his first sermon, the "Discourse Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma" (Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta). In the Chain of Conditioned Arising (paticca samuppada) he explained that tanha originates as a reaction to bodily sensations.<br/><br/>

**Tathagata** literally, "thus gone" or "thus come". One who by walking on the path of reality has reached ultimate reality, i.e., an enlightened person. The term by which the Buddha commonly referred to himself.<br/><br/>

**Theravada** literally, "teaching of the elders". The teachings of the Buddha, in the form in which they have been preserved in the countries of south Asia, such as, Burma (now known as Myanmar), Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.

##### V

**Vaya/vyaya** passing away, decay. Vaya-dhamma, the phenomenon of passing away.<br/><br/>

**Vedanā** feeling/sensation. One of the five aggregates (khandha). Described by the Buddha as having both mental and physical aspects; therefore vedana offers a means to examine the totality of the mental-physical phenomenon. In the Chain of Conditioned Arising (paticca samuppada), the Buddha explained that tanha, the cause of suffering, arising as a reaction tovedana. By learning to observe vedana objectively one can avoid any new reactions, and can experience directly within oneself the reality of impermanence (anicca). This experience is essential for the development of detachment, leading to liberation of the mind.<br/><br/>

**Vedananupassanā **observation of sensations within the body. See Satipaṭṭhāna.<br/><br/>

**Vinnana** consciousness, cognition. One of the five aggregates (khandha).<br/><br/>
