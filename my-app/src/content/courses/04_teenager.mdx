_Vipassana is the practical science of living. The next generation must learn this science at a very young age, so that they can live a very healthy life, a harmonious life. If they understand pure Dhamma, the law of nature, they will live according to the law of nature_.<br/>
**_~S. N .Goenka_**<br/><br/>

Vipassana Meditation is an ancient method of gaining wisdom by insight - looking at the interaction of one's own mind and body. It is a logical process of mental purification through self-observation. Taught in ten-day residential courses, the practice of Vipassana, which means 'seeing things as they really are,' has benefitted people from every class, race, religion and continent due to its non-sectarian nature.<br/><br/>

Many come to Vipassana late in their lives, wishing they had found this technique earlier because it is so effective in learning the art of living peacefully and harmoniously. The ideal time to begin this mental training is in childhood, when children as young as eight years, can easily learn the technique of Anapana meditation, the first preparatory step in learning Vipassana. The first Anapana courses for children between 8 to 16 years were held in 1985, and have spread rapidly since, not only in India but in all parts of the world.<br/><br/>

#### Vipassana for Teenagers

<Divider />

“_We give the seed of pure Dhamma to these boys and girls and after 15 or 20 years the new generation that comes up will have responsibility towards their family, towards society, the country, the world, towards humanity. They should grow up to be ideal human beings. This is our only aim._” <br/>
**_~S.N. Goenka​_**<br/><br/>

Teenage is an extremely difficult period when the individual goes through various physical and mental changes. Children and young adults go through a lot of stress. The pressure of school, meeting expectations of parents and teachers, and planning out a career for themselves puts them under considerable strain and tension. Added to this is the adolescents’ experience of his/her own intense feelings of joy, sorrow, fear, love, disappointment and anger. Relationships with friends are of utmost importance and success or failure in these interactions weighs heavily on them. They have to go through formal education in these formative years and at the same time, need to develop their self-confidence and a sense of personal identity.<br/><br/>

The metaphor of ‘twilight’ can be aptly used to describe this age group; for them, no more childlike, innocent faith of one below 14; they are now objectively critical and yet, not complete, mature adults. They are on the threshold of becoming adults, at the junction between adolescence and adulthood, hence this transition period is very important.<br/><br/>

Mind training is particularly important in this period because bad mental habits tend to persist when one grows up. Many psychological problems in adulthood are sown during childhood and adolescence, making the individual less productive and less creative. Therefore, introducing a seed of Vipassana early in life will help them to master their mind and live a peaceful and harmonious life.<br/><br/>

With this objective, a 7-day Vipassana course was designed for the teenagers and introduced in April 2004 at Dhamma Giri. Till then, the teenagers had access only to Anapana meditation. With this first course, the gates to Vipassana were thrown open to this group. Since then, courses have been held all over India, Myanmar and Nepal benefitting thousands of teen-aged boys and girls.<br/><br/>

#### Structure of a 7-Day Vipassana Course and Eligibility

<Divider />

The 7-day Vipassana courses are designed for young people aged 15 (completed) to 19 years. Such courses are mostly conducted at established Vipassana meditation centers. <br/><br/>

In this course, the technique of Vipassana Meditation is taught in 7-day residential courses during which participants follow a prescribed Code of Discipline, learn the basics of the method, and practice sufficiently to experience its beneficial results. <br/><br/>

In 7-day courses, participants have to stay within the course premises for the entire duration of the course. They are also expected to refrain from all kinds of religious practices or other disciplines for that period.<br/><br/>

There are three steps to the training. The first step is, for the period of the course, to abstain from killing, stealing, sexual activity, speaking falsely, and consuming intoxicants. This simple code of moral conduct serves to calm the mind, which otherwise would be too agitated to perform the task of self-observation.<br/><br/>

The next step is to develop some mastery over the mind by learning to fix one's attention on the natural reality of the ever changing flow of breath as it enters and leaves the nostrils. By the third day, the mind is calmer and more focused, better able to undertake the practice of Vipassana itself: observing sensations throughout the body, understanding their nature, and developing equanimity by learning not to react to them. Finally, on the last full day, participants learn the meditation of metta-bhavana (loving kindness or goodwill towards all), in which the purity developed during the course, is shared with all beings.<br/><br/>

The entire practice is actually a mental training. Just as we use physical exercises to improve our bodily health, Vipassana can be used to develop a healthy mind.<br/><br/>

Of course, the results come gradually through continued practice. It is unrealistic to expect all problems to be solved in seven days. Within that time, however, the essentials of Vipassana can be learned so that it can be applied in daily life.<br/><br/>

#### Difference between 10-Day and 7-Day Courses

<Divider />

**7-day teenager courses stand out distinctly from 10-day courses in the following aspects**: <br/><br/>

- The participants of 7-day course belong to a specified age group (15 to 19 years). While 10-day courses are open to all adults above 19 years of age.

- 7-day courses, while retaining the seriousness and intensity of the 10-day courses, address the specific needs of this age group. The technique is the same as on the 10-day courses for adults, but with evening talks that are more suited to teenagers and a more relaxed time table.

- 7-day courses are single gender courses, either male or female courses at a time, irrespective of the capacity of the Center.

#### Course Charges

<Divider />

All courses are run solely on the basis of voluntarily offered donations. There is no fee charged. The courses are financed by donations from the students who have completed a prior course and wish to share the benefits they themselves received, by giving donations for the students who come after them.<br/><br/>

#### Impact on Course Participants

<Divider />

Participants have reported multifold changes and benefits from the courses with a significant gain in cognitive, social and emotional factors. Some reported that it improved their concentration and that they scored well in the tests conducted. Many felt that they were able to manage their negative feelings, especially anger. This helped them to calm down more quickly and they were able to avoid fights at home.<br/><br/>

Many students reported that meditation helped them to cope better in their lives. They found that it made them calmer, and more focused in studies and less violent and angry. On the social front, many students, who were initially feeling socially isolated and lonely, were able to mix up with others comfortably.<br/><br/>

One girl of Class VIII wrote she has learnt to be more patient and not to lose her temper. Another girl said that she was glad that her confused mind learnt to become more focused and positive.<br/><br/>

Detailed research has been undertaken to study the impact of Vipassana on teenagers.

#### Experiences

**My First Course**
<br />
<br />

_(Sarah attended her first Vipassana course in early 1980s. At that time, there were no seperate teenagers' courses. She gave following talk at the International Seminar on "The Importance Of Vedana and Sampajanna" held at Dhamma Giri in March 1990.)_

My name is Sarah and I am here to tell you of my experience doing my first ten-day course.<br/><br/>

I loved the idea of being able to come to India, but having to do the course was a different story. I do want to, I don't want to, I do, I don't. It was like that for a few weeks, but one day my mother told me to meet Mr. Ram Singh and his wife Mrs. Jagdish. So that morning I walked over with some flowers. Me and my mother sat down on the floor, but Mr. Ram Singh said we could not sit on a lower level than him and so we sat on chairs.<br/><br/>

I gave him the flowers and then said 'hello', and my mother introduced me and then herself and then told Mr. Ram Singh about how my elder brother, David, went to India last year. You could say that my brief visit to Mr. Ram Singh was sukha (pleasant) -sukha, sukha, not an iota of dukha (unpleasant). "I' m going to India!" I said, and that was definite.<br/><br/>

A few weeks later, we arrived in India at about two o'clock in the morning Indian time. The next day we set off to Igatpuri. Once we had settled in, we went and got ready for an hour's group sit and introduction to meditation and S. N. Goenka.<br/><br/>

Next day after breakfast I got ready for the eight o'clock group sit and then went to the hall. A very big amount of females went in and I went along with them. I went to my place near the front, sat down and got comfortable then closed my eyes, but after about ten seconds opened them again and looked around, and after five minutes everyone was in and a strange talking started. All the time I had my eyes open, but the strange talking said "close your eyes", so I did.<br/><br/>

I started concentrating on the upper area under the nostrils and above the upper lip. Hot, cold, fast, slow, left, right, prickly, smooth, hard, soft - these were all my sensations. But suddenly they all went, they all left me. Where had they gone?<br/><br/>

Then soon I realized my mind had wandered, wandered to school, so off I went to find my mind, to find and to bring it back to the area of the lower nostril and upper lip. But when I found it I got pulled into the thoughts of school and my fellow classmates, and this is what happened in all my other hours, half hours, minutes, seconds of all my meditation hours.<br/><br/>

Until along came the wonderful technique of Vipassana. Along came day four and we were to learn Vipassana after the morning group sit. Vipassana was to be taught and I closed my eyes and got comfortable. This morning, I thought, I couldn't possibly sit through two hours even if it was Vipassana, and I even expressed my feelings to my mother and my two friends Debbie and Uwana who helped me get through the ten days.<br/><br/>

But now in the hall I was eager to learn Vipassana and I totally neglected my first thoughts. At last Mr.& Mrs. S. N. Goenka and Vimala, the assistant teacher for females and the male assistant teacher came in and at last I was to learn Vipassana. I paid little attention to S. N. Goenka's first minor speech but finally I was taught Vipassana. "Feeling sensations all over the body" and I did. Again I got prickly, smooth, soft, hard, fast, slow and all other sensations over my body. But again my mind wandered, but this time I brought it back again.<br/><br/>

I was also taught the minor technique of Mettā Bhavana.<br/><br/>

To finish my rather long speech I would like to tell you about a rather important day that probably happens to most people on their courses. This day was around day five and this was probably the best day of the course. That day I was full of anger, meanness, unkindness, and wouldn't do anything I didn't want to do, and showed it all immensely. But late that same night I realized that that day was the day all my sankharas didn't like me anymore and decided to go to someone else, and then I suddenly felt happy.<br/><br/>

When the course was over I couldn't believe how somebody could ever be so happy as I was that day and practically vowed to myself to come back next year, may be with my younger brother.<br/><br/>

I'm sukha, sukha, not an iota of dukha, a thousand time over.<br/><br/>

_The teaching was good and it brought a lot of awareness in us. Things we didn’t know. Next time we are in trouble we know exactly what to do. I didn’t have any dislikes about the course. I enjoyed it. I don’t have any suggestions to make. I had a good experience. At first I was restless and impatient. I could meditate properly only for 5 minutes. On the 5th day I did not have much of a problem. I have learnt how to be patient and not to lose my temper. I will practice for 20 minutes every day_.

**_~Kavishta, VIII B_**

<Divider />

_I liked everything about this and I hope that everyone understands and practices meditation. It is quite difficult at first to meditate but after you get used to it, it is nice. It was very interesting and quite nice. It has certainly been very helpful. At the beginning I didn’t take it very seriously but by the end, I found it really captivating and I hope to practice everyday, twice a day. I find myself remembering things I would have usually missed and a lot more calm. I can concentrate a lot better too_.

**_~Lakshmi, VI B_**

<Divider />

_The first and second day, I thought were very interesting and it was because my mind was calm and I had vibrations. Afterwards, I felt bored sitting straight and concentrating on my breath. Seeing the video and listening to the tapes were interesting. The best thing I like about meditation is keeping quiet. I wish we had meditation class one period every day_.

**_~Karmanya, VI A_**

<Divider />

_I liked the peacefulness that comes into our mind and makes you feel good. I would not say I did not like anything, but it was stressful to sit for a long time. My leg started to pain but slowly the pain went away. The day we started was a little tough but by practice enjoyed it_.

**_~Karishma Menon, VI_**

<Divider />

_I liked meditation very much, but it was difficult keeping our eyes closed for more than 10 minutes, sometimes 15 minutes and 25 minutes and sometimes for 30 minutes! I liked meditation because it removed all our worries and when we were very sad, it would change our mood. And mam explained very nicely and she told us stories on that topic and she also told us one point, that nothing is permanent. When we did the 30 minutes meditation, I had a real headache and I felt the world was going round and round_.

**_~Ammar, VI_**

<Divider />

_The course was very good. The things taught and the way of teaching is very good. Make the course a little longer because we have now only settled. I liked the course very much. I have tried to increase my concentration and all other positive qualities. After meditation I feel fresh and peaceful. I will try and practice daily in the morning after getting up for 10 minutes and in the evening before studying for 10 minutes_.

**_~Vijay Karthik, VIII_**

<Divider />

_I like the way they taught us and how kind they were with us and how they taught us the technique or the art of ignoring jealousy egoness etc. I did not have any dislikes I realy enjoyed it. I experienced the truth about pain that how you can control our anger and I really found out the truth about pain and could control my anger, jealousy and telling lies. I could see the difference in 5 days. I could really study faster and sleep well with this daily practice_.

**_~Amita Joy, VIII_**

<Divider />

_I was very nice to learn how it meditate. It was wonderful. It is a nice method to calm yourself. It was very easy to do. It was not so difficult. Whenever you are upset practice this method and see how you feel and how you change in a second Thank you Radhi mam for all things you taught us. I really very happy to see you_.

**_~Sneha, VI_**

<Divider />

_I want the other children to see the T.V. episodes, the charts that Radhi mam and Sabrina man had done, and show them the happy and lovely journey to them. I also like the OHP's pictures_.

_There is nothing I dislike in my meditation class. I like it very much. I want the people teaching to take the course for more days, unlike one week_.

_When I first came here I found myself in many difficulties in doing this Anapana Sati. After learning how to avoid the difficulties and distractions I began to know how to change quickly from unhappiness to happiness_.

_After I learnt this Anapana I became clam and quite. I learnt how to control things and discover that nothing is permanent_.

\_I am taking a vow that I will avoid wrong actions and always practice Anapana Sati every day two times<br/>

- Morning – 10 or 20 min
- Evening – 10 or 20 min\_

**_~S.Vadivukarasi, VI_**

<Divider />

_My likes were the charts and the television programmes and the OHP. I would suggest you to show all these things in our course to other children. I have no dislike, because the course was completely useful and very nice and interesting too. I would suggest that these pamphlets and other things I learned during the course would be taught to other children to improve their concentration. I also suggest that you can make this course more interesting for other people. I have experienced aches and pains coming but by doing the Anapana Sati. I have experienced them going. This helped me concentrate a lot. I would practice daily for 20 minutes minimum. Thank you Sabrina Aunty for this nice course_.

**_~Saba_**

<Divider />

_I like the sila because along with the Anapana Sati it determines you not to do certain things and do certain things. I has made me a wiser person. I dislike the aches and pains but I try to tolerate as much as I can. Take this in many other schools. I was difficult as first became easier as time went. I was cheerful the whole. Never go upset for along time. I determined to do it every day even during the free time_.

**_~Prateshta VI_**

<Divider />

_Meditation class is that my mind felt calm and the ten or fifteen minutes made me happy. I felt a lot of vibrations and felt as I was flying in thin air. The teacher said some interesting stores nice morals. Like as the seed so the fruit and some more. She put up charts. As the first it was quiet tough and not so easy. The teacher showed videos and she played a tape in which her Guru Sri Sathyanarayan Goenka had taped some interesting things about meditation_.

_I liked everything. I do not name anything I did not like. Everything I liked except one thing the teacher should not have given as a break but I enjoyed it. It changed every thing. I would like to tell the teacher something that is thank you_.

**_~Aishwarya_**

<Divider />

_I have learnt meditation for the first time. At first I thought it was such a bore but later after I gave it a try. I liked it a lot_.

_Anapana Sati has helped me a lot in my mental peace, calmness, etc. I mostly get angry at things when I am not in a mood but this practice has helped me calm down_.

_There's nothing about this wonderful class I dislike. I like it a lot_!

_Giving a cushion or a mat would be much much better because the ground gives me aches all over. I also hope you would come to our class every day to meditate. As I have written before I like a lot. I was fun and I learnt and lot.. I am also teaching my cousins_.

_I get the benefit in my studies, my tension, etc. I practice Anapana Sati for 10 min every day morning night and evening_.

**_~Rifah, VIII_**

<Divider />

_Meditation was a very nice vibration and I felt calm for the 1st 4 days. But the 5th day was a very boring. I did not feel the vibration. But it was very nice. The first day my head was paining_.

_Thank you Radhi mam for all your kindness and helpfullness. I am very thankfull to you mam_.

**_~Mansa, VI_**

<Divider />

_I want my schoolmates to watch the T.V. episodes and learn that by meditating you can become more successful in your life_.

_We din't have time to read the things which were put up in the wall. May be you can given them 5 minutes to just look around the things in the wall. It is a great help to those who are a dull student of a class_.

_You have changed me into a good girl_.

_I will try my best to do 2 times a day_.

**_~Aroona R., VI_**

<Divider />

_The meditation was very nice. It helped us to master our mind. I liked it very much and it was a little difficult but I could do it. When the teacher told us to do meditation before we studied and I did it and it was helpful. I thank you for helping me to concentrate_.

**_~Vishag, VI_**

<Divider />

_The meditation was good for me because it helped me focus on my studies much better. When I meditated before my studies and got very good marks_.

_It was very good because I could focus my mind so well in my studies. I did not have anything else on my mind but studies. My mind was clear_.

**_~Vishal Abraham, VI_**

<Divider />

_I like the way they are punctual.
I do not like everytime removing my shoes and come into the room.
At first I like the meditation but now I feel it is a little boring.
I feel I can concentrate a lot now. I am going to practice but only 5 minutes._

**_~Varuna, VI_**

<Divider />

_At first I felt that I just couldn't keep my eyes closed for a long time because it was very hard to be tolerant, but gradually it became easier and I accepted the pain and also got rid of it through Anapana Sati. I think that I could have meditated for longer if my eyes had been open. I've become little calmer and left better after this course._
