_May all suffering people of the world understand what is Dhamma, may they practice Dhamma, may they apply Dhamma in their day-to-day life and come out of all the agonies of a defiled mind full of negativities. May all enjoy the peace and harmony of a pure mind, a mind full of compassionate love and goodwill towards other beings_.<br/>
