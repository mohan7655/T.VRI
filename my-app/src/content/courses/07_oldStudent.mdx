_May all suffering people of the world understand what is Dhamma, may they practice Dhamma, may they apply Dhamma in their day-to-day life and come out of all the agonies of a defiled mind full of negativities. May all enjoy the peace and harmony of a pure mind, a mind full of compassionate love and goodwill towards other beings_.<br/>
**_- S.N. Goenka_**<br/><br/>

_"**Old Students**” are those who have completed at least one 10-day course with Mr. S. N. Goenka or his assistant teachers. In addition to ten-day courses, the following courses are offered to old students_.<br/><br/>

#### Short Courses

<Divider />

Short courses with the duration of 2 to 3 days are held at many centers. These are designed to refresh understanding of the technique of Vipassana and strengthen the practice. To see the schedule of short courses, please click here. <br/><br/>

In addition to short courses, many one day courses as well as hourly group sittings are conducted at center and non-center locations. To see the schedule of one day courses and group sittings, please click here.<br/><br/>

#### Long Courses

<Divider />

Long courses of 20, 30, 45 and 60 days are offered for old students at long course centres like Dhamma Tapovana, established for this purpose. These courses have certain requirements which an old student must meet in order to qualify for admission. To see the current list of long courses and requirement criterias, please click here.<br/><br/>

In long as well as short courses, the technique remains the same. In such courses, students get a chance of getting established in Vipassana with a greater continuity of practice.<br/><br/>

#### Course Charges

<Divider />

As with all Vipassana courses in this tradition, there are no charges for any of the above courses - not even to cover the cost of food and accommodation. All expenses are met by voluntary donations from people who, having completed a course and experienced the benefits of Vipassana themselves, wish to give others the opportunity to benefit as well. Such donations are only accepted from people once they have completed a 10-Day course and can therefore, give with this volition.
