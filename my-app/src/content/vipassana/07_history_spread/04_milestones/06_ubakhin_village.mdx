The Sayagyi U Ba Khin Village was one of three major projects to be taken up to mark the birth centenary of Sayagyi U Ba Khin in 1999. This unique facility for meditators with bungalows and flats enables students from all over the world to reside adjacent to Dhamma Giri.  All residents are required to observe the five precepts.<br/><br/>

The Asoka Pillar, with the Wheel of Dhamma atop, situated near the Myanmar Gate is a symbol of deep gratitude to Emperor Ashoka who sent Vipassana to the neighbouring countries. Had Emperor Ashoka not sent Vipassana to Myanmar, it would have been lost totally.<br/><br/>

A Buddha Park has been constructed near the Community Centre. It includes an exhibition of fine marble engravings depicting important events in the life of the Buddha.<br/><br/>

The Sayagyi U Ba Khin Village is an idyllic dwelling place for meditators.<br/><br/>
