**_चरथ, भिक्खवे, चारिकं बहुजनहिताय बहुजनसुखाय लोकानुकम्पाय अत्थाय हिताय <br/ >
सुखाय देवमनुस्सानं। मा एकेन द्वे अगमित्थ। देसेथ, भिक्खवे, धम्मं आदिकल्याणं <br/ >
मज्झेकल्याणं परियोसानकल्याणं सात्थं सब्यञ्‍जनं केवलपरिपुण्णं परिसुद्धं <br/ >ब्रह्मचरियं पकासेथ। सन्ति सत्ता अप्परजक्खजातिका, अस्सवनता धम्मस्स <br/ >परिहायन्ति। भविस्सन्ति धम्मस्स अञ्‍ञातारो।"_** <br/><br/>
**_Go your ways, oh monks! for the benefit and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, benefit, and happiness of gods and men. Let no two go in the same direction. Teach, oh monks, the Dhamma, which is beneficial in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end - both the spirit and the letter of it. Make known the Noble Life, which is fully complete (requiring no addition) and pure (requiring no subtraction). There are beings with only a little dust in their eyes who will be lost unless they hear the Dhamma. Such persons will understand the truth._**"<br/><br/>

**-Dutiyā Mārapāsa Sutta, Saṃyutta Nikāya, IV (I).5** <br/><br/>

With these inspiring words, the Buddha exhorted his first 60 fully liberated (arahant) disciples, to go in different directions, with loving compassion, to teach Vipassana for the benefit of many, for the welfare of many. The Buddha himself compassionately distributed Dhamma throughout northern India, attracting a large number of people. <br/><br/>

Even Kings like Bimbisāra, Suddhodana, and Prasenajita received great benefit from their practice of the Dhamma and enthusiastically supported the dissemination of the Buddha’s teaching in their respective kingdoms. Yet the fact remains that the Vipassana spread to the masses not only because of this royal patronage but because of the efficacy of the technique itself.<br/><br/>
