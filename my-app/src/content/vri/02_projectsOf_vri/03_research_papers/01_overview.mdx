#### Health

Studies have established its beneficial role as a positive mental health measure in various psychosomatic disorders, personality disorders, besides, alcohol and drug abuse & addiction. Numerous anecdotal case reports of persons suffering from various health disorders, both physical and mental, are available pointing out the therapeutic efficacy of Vipassana. Besides, the technique has found ready acceptance with the healers of diverse disciplines, such as, Yoga, Naturopathy, Homeopathy, Ayurveda, Allopathy, etc., as it is free from dogmas, based on experience and focussed on relief from human suffering. However, it needs to be emphasized that any such health benefit is considered to be just a by-product of this profound technique of mental purification. The practice of Vipassana does hasten the healing process but more importantly, it transforms one’s approach to life and its vicissitudes. One learns to face all sickness and suffering with equanimity; the healers too augment their ability to be a professional anchor to the sick in the tumult of their lives.

#### Education

Vipassana being a scientific and secular technique, has been found to be an ideal instrument to develop the emotional and spiritual dimensions of a child’s personality, allowing him to grow into a balanced, confident and happy human being. Children courses are being conducted in India since 1986 and over the years, they have continued to gather momentum both here and abroad.

#### Social Change

Many scientific studies have been carried out on the positive impact of Vipassana on one’s personality and interpersonal relationships, etc. Research conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has established that Vipassana meditation increases persons’ control of their emotions resulting in a reduction in feelings of anger, tension, hostility, revenge and helplessness. Drug addiction, neurotic and psychopathological symptoms also get diminished. In addition, prison inmates practising Vipassana meditation have shown an increased willingness to work, to participate in other treatment programmes, to abide by prison rules and to co-operate with prison authorities. The striking example of Dhamma Tihar has attracted many prisons all over the world to use Vipassana meditation as a tool for rehabilitation. The study conducted under the auspices of the University of Washington indicates a significant decrease in recidivism of the jail inmates practising Vipassana. The Jail Personnel of the North Rehabilitation Facility (NRF) in Seattle, Washington found that those who complete the Vipassana course are calmer, better disciplined and more reasonable. The result of all these researches is that Vipassana is now being practiced in prisons in USA, Spain, Mexico, Thailand, Taiwan, and New Zealand.

#### Organisation and Management Development

With an increasing demand from professionals in various fields and government officials and white collared workforce a course was designed to specially cater to the demanding and stressful lifestyles of a professional career. This has been well received by high-ranking government officials and business executives. Since 2003-04 more than 800 personnel have been trained in Vipassana under this programme. It was held in Mandarin language for Taiwanese and Chinese countrymen. Addressing this segment of the population through such courses and analyzing the results in this vast field of corporate management is an ongoing effort by VRI. Many management institutes like Symbiosis and Sadhana Institute of Pune have made 10-day Vipassana course as a part of their curriculum.<br/><br/>

The Government of Maharashtra has been a pioneer in introducing Vipassana to State Government officials since 1996. Since 2003, the government has been granting commuted leave of 14 days to attend a Vipassana course to all employees of the state government. Organisations such as Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (YASHADA), Pune have also followed suit. The recognition of the good effect of Vipassana by the Government of Maharashtra is so evident that Courses for children are included in its Mumbai schools as part of activity.<br/><br/>

MITRA stands for Mind in Training for Right Awareness. Project MITRA has been formed to spread awareness about Anapana and Vipassana courses in the education sector in the State of Maharashtra.<br/><br/>
