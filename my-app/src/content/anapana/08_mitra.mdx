It was the great foresight of Mr S.N Goenka that all schools should teach the practice of Anapana in childhood. To ensure this, it was necessary that school teachers first learn to practice Vipassana so that they could help the children practice regularly. For this, the Maharashtra State Government circulated a GR to all its schools thus encouraging the teachers to do a course in Vipassana.<br/>

The MITRA Upakram program was set up by the Vipassana Research Institute(VRI) in collaboration with the Maharashtra Government. Several volunteer Vipassana meditaors  worked together to implement the programme and make it successful. Thanks to this programme, approximately 2.5 crore students will now be taught Anapana in Maharashtra.<br/>
