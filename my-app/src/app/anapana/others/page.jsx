        Anapana is the first step in the practice of Vipassana meditation.
        Anapana means observation of natural, normal respiration, as it comes in
        and as it goes out. It is an easy to learn, objective and scientific
        technique that helps develop concentration of the mind.
        <br />
        <br /> Observation of the breath is the ideal object for meditation
        because it is always available and it is completely non-sectarian.
        Anapana is very different from techniques that are based on the
        artificial regulation of breath. There are no rites or rituals involved
        in the practice or presentation of Anapana. <br />
        <br />
        Anapana provides a tool to deal with the fears, anxieties and pressures
        across all age groups. Besides helping to calm and concentrate the mind,
        Anapana help people to understand themselves better and gives them an
        insight into the workings of their own minds. Because of its simplicity,
        the technique is easy to understand and practice.

        Why Natural Respiration?
      </Typography>
      <Text variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        The goal of Vipassana meditation is not the concentration of the mind
        but to purify the mind completely, by eradicating all mental impurities
        such as anger, hatred, passion, fear. Vipassana is the analytical study
        of the mind and body (matter). To achieve this, one must gain complete
        knowledge of the body, of the mind and of the mental impurities at the
        experiential level, which is done with the help of respiration.
        Respiration acts like a bridge between the conscious and the unconscious
        mind and between voluntary and involuntary processes of the body. <br />
        <br />
        The first step of this technique is to develop awareness of the present
        reality. Life can really be lived only in the present. When one observes
        respiration, one begins to understand the nature of the mind. The mind
        is very fleeting, very fickle - this reality becomes very clear. It
        never stays in the present, constantly tries to escape into a past or
        future that is unattainable. The past moment is gone forever. Even in
        return for all the wealth in the world, one cannot bring back that
        moment. Similarly, one cannot live in the future. When the future
        becomes the present, only then can one live in it. One has not learned
        how to live - one has not learned the Art of living. By observing
        natural respiration, we slowly train our mind to live in present.
        <br />
        <br /> Another reason for adopting natural incoming and outgoing breath
        as the object of concentration is that the rhythm of our respiration has
        an intimate natural connection with the negativities of the mind. When
        the mind is polluted and overpowered by any harmful negativity such as
        anger, fear, lust, envy or any other, we see that the rhythm of our
        respiration naturally becomes rapid and gross. When these negativities
        stop polluting the mind, the rhythm of respiration becomes slow and
        subtle. <br />
        <br /> Observing the natural breath is a universal practice. Breath is
        breath, not a Hindu breath, a Muslim breath or a Christian breath. Thus,
        Anapana becomes universal.

        Difference between Vipassana and Anapana
      </Typography>
      <Text variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        The goal of Vipassana is to purify the mind of all impurities whereas
        the goal of Anapana is concentration of mind. <br />
        <br />
        Vipassana means "to see things as they really are"; it is a logical
        process of mental purification through self-observation. For
        self-observation, one penetrates one's entire physical and mental
        structure with the clarity of insight. For this, we need a medium, a
        tool, which will lead us to the root level of the mind, from where the
        negativities and impurities arise - that medium is the breath. Observing
        the breath is called Anapana.
        <br />
        <br /> Anapana meditation is a way through which the restless fleeting
        mind can be drawn back to a particular object or base, thus bringing the
        mind under control. Just as an untamed calf must be tied to a stake to
        prevent it from wandering away, so also the mind must be tied down to
        the “stake” (the base of the nose) by the “rope” (the knowing of each
        incoming and outgoing breath) to make it calm and steady. Anapana
        meditation has its own immense benefits, but it is the means, not the
        end. It helps us to concentrate the mind, so that mind is calmer and
        more focused, thereby, better able to undertake the practice of
        Vipassana itself.
