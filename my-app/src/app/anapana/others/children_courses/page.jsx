          One should live peacefully and harmoniously in accordance with the law
          of nature—not harming oneself or others. Now this art of living is
          difficult to learn in old age, so the training should start at a young
          age. In the schools children should learn the art of living a healthy

        Anapana Courses for Children
      </Typography>
      <Text variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        In a time of worldwide social transition and upheaval, more and more
        people throughout the world are seeking concentration, purification and
        peace of mind through the practice of{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.vridhamma.org/What-is-Vipassana">
          Vipassana meditation.
        </Link>
        Vipassana means "to see things as they really are" and is a logical
        process of mental purification through self-observation. Many come to
        Vipassana late in their lives, wishing they had found this technique
        earlier because it is so effective in learning the art of living
        peacefully and harmoniously. The ideal time to begin the first steps of
        this mental training is in childhood when children as young as eight
        years old can easily learn the technique of
        <Link href="">Anapana meditation.</Link>
        <br />
        <br />
        Anapana is the first step in the practice of Vipassana meditation.
        Anapana means observation of natural, normal respiration, as it comes in
        and as it goes out. It is an easy-to-learn, objective and scientific
        technique which helps develop concentration of the mind. Observation of
        the breath is the ideal object for meditation because it is always
        available, and it is completely non-sectarian. Anapana is very different
        from techniques that are based on artificial regulation of the breath.
        There are no rites or rituals involved in the practice or presentation
        of Anapana.
        <br />
        <br />
        The ideal time to begin the first steps of this mental training is in
        childhood. Besides helping children to calm and concentrate their minds,
        Anapana helps them to understand themselves better and gives them an
        insight into the workings of their own minds. They develop an inner
        strength that helps them to choose right and appropriate actions over
        wrong actions, control and become master of their own mind. Anapana
        provides them with a tool to deal with the fears, anxieties and
        pressures of childhood and adolescence. Because of its simplicity,
        children find the technique easy to understand and practice. <br />
        <br />
        This approach is traced back to{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.vridhamma.org/gotama-the-buddha">
          the Buddha
        </Link>{" "}
        , who rediscovered and taught this technique nearly 2,500 years ago. The
        Buddha never taught a sectarian religion; he taught{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.vridhamma.org/What-is-Dhamma">Dhamma</Link> -
        the Universal Law of Nature. Following this tradition, this technique is
        presented in a totally non-sectarian approach. For this reason, it has
        had a profound appeal to people of all backgrounds, of every religion or
        no religion, from every part of the world.

        A technique for Today

        Children today are growing up in a fractured and rapidly changing world.
        They need help to meet the challenges facing them and to develop their
        full potential. Anapana courses can help them find a way to live
        peacefully and productively, and to make the society in which we live
        more peaceful. In the words of{" "}

          Mr. S. N. Goenka

        <b>What is the right age to start meditating?</b>
        <br /> <br />
        It’s a question that Goenkaji has often been asked, and his answer is
        usually the same:{" "}

          <i>

        Not all of us have been fortunate enough to have such an early exposure
        to{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.vridhamma.org/What-is-Dhamma">the Dhamma</Link>,
        or to give our children such an early start. But more than ever, there
        are opportunities for children to learn the basics of meditation. And
        the results are often startling.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the past 15 years, hundreds of Anapana courses have been conducted
        exclusively for children around the world. These courses have yielded
        substantial benefits for the thousands of children who have attended
        them. Many of them have experienced a positive change in their outlook,
        behaviour and attitude. Many have found their ability to concentrate has
        improved and that their memory has strengthened. And above all, these
        children have acquired a tool that is of immense value to them for the
        rest of their lives. Children are, by nature, active and enthusiastic,
        with an eagerness to learn and explore. For this reason, it is
        appropriate to offer them an opportunity to explore themselves and their
        mind with all its hidden faculties, latent abilities and subtle
        complexities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Learning Anapana plants a wholesome interest in self-introspection and
        meditation, which may open an entirely new dimension of life for them
        later on. Anapana courses for children have been conducted since 1986.
        These courses have been offered to children of various ages belonging to
        different socio-economic and cultural groups. They have been conducted
        in Vipassana meditation centres as well as at schools and other
        institutions, and are both residential and non-residential. Whether a
        children's Anapana course is held at a school or at a{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.vridhamma.org/Vipassana-Centers">
          Vipassana meditation centre
        </Link>
        , it is essential that the students be given an opportunity to continue
        to practise Anapana for a short period each day after the course to
        yield the true benefits of the practice.

        Children Courses - History & Spread
      </Typography>
      <Text variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        Mr. Vinoba Bhave, a leading disciple of Mahatma Gandhi, was instrumental
        in starting children courses in India. After meeting Mr. S. N. Goenka in
        the 1970s, Mr. Bhave was impressed with his work but he said, “I will
        believe this is worthwhile only if you can show that it works with
        hardened criminals and undisciplined school children.” Mr. Goenka gladly
        accepted the challenge and the course was arranged for the children
        which was very sucessful.
        <br /> <br />
        After this initial course, more than a decade passed until the launch of
        a formal meditation program for children. The first course took place in
        1986, in a school located in the Mumbai suburb of Juhu. It was followed
        by many more courses, in India and around the world. Meditators
        enthusiastically stepped forward to serve. Although the format kept
        evolving; the response from participants, parents and teachers has
        consistently been positive.
        <br /> <br />
        In addition to courses in Government & semi-government schools, regular
        children courses are conducted for special groups like autistic
        children, homeless children, orphans, children with hearing and speech
        impairments, and children with physical and mental disabilities. The
        Government of Maharastra passed a GR No{" "}

        on 5th October, 2011 for introduction of Anapana Courses to all primary
        and secondary schools in the state of Maharashtra.

        How a Children Course Works
      </Typography>
      <Text variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        Today separate courses welcome children aged 8 to 12 and teens aged 13
        to 16. Often the program starts in the morning and ends in the evening,
        There are also two and three-day courses.
        <br /> <br />
        Conducting the course is a children’s course teacher, who has undergone
        special training at a workshop. Along with the teacher are group
        leaders, each working closely with a small number of children.
        <br /> <br />
        Short meditation periods alternate with supervised play and activities,
        such as drawing and discussion. The objective is to give the
        participants an enjoyable experience, help them feel comfortable in a
        meditation environment and introduce them to the basics of Anapana.
        <br /> <br />
        Often the course site is a Vipassana meditation center but sometimes it
        is a rented facility. And sometimes, courses are held in schools as a
        recognized part of the curriculum.

        Course Structure
      </Typography>
      <Text variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        To learn Anapana, it is necessary to take an Anapana Course under the
        guidance of a qualified teacher.
        <br /> <br />
        There are two steps to the training: In the first step the children make
        a conscious effort to abstain from all kinds of unwholesome actions.
        They undertake five moral precepts: practicing abstention from killing,
        stealing, lying, sexual misconduct and use of intoxicants and follow the
        code of conduct. The observation of these precepts allows the mind to
        calm down enough to proceed for the next step.
        <br /> <br />
        Next they learn and practice Anapana meditation - focusing attention on
        the breath as it comes in and goes out naturally. The entire teaching in
        all these courses is conducted through audio & video tapes of Mr. S. N.
        Goenka, principal teacher of Vipassana meditation, who reintroduced this
        teaching in India and many other countries. Each course is divided into
        small sessions of 30-40 minutes which includes both practice and
        understanding of the theory. Residential courses also include games and
        other creative activities. However more time is allocated to the
        practice of the technique. The course concludes with the practice of
        Metta-bhavna (loving kindness or goodwill towards all) in which peace
        and happiness gained during the course is shared with all beings.
